Masters of trade, merchant guilds can play an important part in the politics of an empire. Upset your merchant guild masters and you may find the prices of grain, iron or wood increase, putting pressure on a nobility's ability to run their kingdom.

Aothir is no exception to this, with many kingdoms or free cities having representation for their merchant guilds in government or advisory committee. Democratic governments may have a Head of Commerce, responsible for policy changes that both regulate and benefit the trade of an empire, whereas a country run by a Monarchy may have members of prominent guilds as part of the King or Queen's advisory board, either as a practical or honorary position.

As a [[Guild Types#Social|social guild]] that covers the broad scope of commerce and trade, there may also be some overlap with guilds whose prominent focus is craftsmanship. Guilds with a big enough presence may have affiliation with a merchant guild which sells their wares.
