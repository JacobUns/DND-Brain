# About
The Gilded Hands are an artisanal guild who specialise in the creation of paintings. The guild are skilled and draw attention from many wealthy and socially prominent patrons. Having created portraits of many important figures, ranging from nobility to prominent political figures on the content of [[Ipthir]], the guild gained a reputation by winning commissions from many royal houses across the continent.

[[Guild Structures#Apprentice Guild Member|Apprentices]] to the guild may rent a bed in the guild hall dorms while they complete their apprenticeship. Once a guild member has reached the [[Guild Structures#Journeyman Guild Member|Journeyman]] level, the guild providers each member with room and board in the guild hall; the more advanced the guild member, the more ostentatious the rooms.

A member that already has room and board elsewhere near the guild hall may choose to decline a room in favour of a storage nook in the building instead for the tools of their craft. As such, there is no limit on the more advanced levels of guild member, but this is not the case for apprentices who must stay in the premises.
