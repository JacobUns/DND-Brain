# About
Aothir is the homebrew work of Jacob, the author of this page and handbook. In pulls from a variety of sources in media, including that of the original source works of Wizards of the Coast, Greek and Celtic Mythology, and works of fiction by such authors as Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan.

Primarily a high fantasy universe, the world of Aothir is a high magic setting. The powers of the arcane have also become a propellant for technology and scientific research, though the practices are in their infancy in comparison to our own. The existence of developing technology that would resemble that of the Napoleonic era is still some distance off, and as such the most common tools of war remain that of the bow and blade. Arcane and mechanical firearms have their place among the elite, and will be used in the defence of large cities should they come under attack. This, of course, also means that there is an existence of firearms in the criminal underworld.

Firearms within the world are exclusively manual in nature, with the technology for automatic fire not being developed. As such, most are lever-action or mechanical revolver style weaponry when developed without magic. Arcane versions are significantly more expensive and significantly more rare. They still require manual action, but their ammunition may be arcane in nature or more reliable than its mechanical counterpart which has the tendency to break or jam regularly.

The [[Aothir Planar Universe]] is a multi-planar structure. The players will primarily exist within the [[Material Plane]], but in some circumstances may travel to other planes as their journeys progress.

The world is multiracial and cultural, pulling inspiration from real-world cultures and races for a multitude of source materials. The races of the world are wildly diverse, but there are recommended [[playable races]] with inspiration for background choices.
