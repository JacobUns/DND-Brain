# About
A major input to the economy of Aothir are its merchants and, by proxy, their [[Aothir Merchants Guilds|merchant guilds]]. With all manner of skills requiring an outlet for goods, any type of goods can be purchased that can be imagined; from antiques and trinkets to vehicles and property, from classic art to tattooing services. Some have more utility in an adventurer's wares and journey than others but all have a place in the global scheme.

Accessories, such as jewellery, may be purchased from the [[Silversmith Stores]] of the continents, weapons and arms from [[Blacksmithing Stores]], potions and elixirs from [[Alchemist Stores]] and magical artefacts from [[Magic Stores]].
