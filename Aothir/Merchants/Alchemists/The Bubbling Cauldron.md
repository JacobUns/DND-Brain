# Quenla Tinkerbrew
Quenla is a cheerful female halfling with curly auburn hair and an apron perpetually dusted with powders and herbs. Her shop is warm and inviting, filled with bubbling cauldrons and shelves lined with colourful bottles. Her potions are reliable but sometimes come with quirky, unexpected side effects.
# Speciality
Quenla's potions combine effects in ways other alchemists deem too risky. For example, a potion that heals and grants temporary invisibility or a draught that enhances strength but changes your hair colour. Adventurers seeking unique edge cases come here.
