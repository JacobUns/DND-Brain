# Zyxil "Fizz" Tinkertwist
Fizz, a non-binary Gnome, is a cheerful, eccentric gnome with goggles perpetually perched on their forehead. Their shop is a riot of color, offering potions that change hues, smells, or effects based on the whims of chaos magic.
# Speciality
Fizz's potions are unpredictable yet delightful. They brew draughts that shift effects based on the user's current mood or environment, such as a strength potion that turns into a levitation serum if you're near a cliff. Fizz also offers "surprise potions" with randomized results for the bold.
# Unique Inventory
## Battle Options
1. **Potion of Colorful Chaos**: Grants a random magical effect (e.g., levitation or glowing eyes) for 1d6 hours.
2. **Chameleon's Quirk**: Allows the user to blend into surroundings, but random patches of color remain visible.
3. **Elemental Roulette Potion**: Temporarily gives the user a random elemental affinity (e.g., fire resistance but weakness to cold).
## Utility Options
1. **Mirthful Mist Draught**: Causes uncontrollable laughter in everyone nearby, disarming tension but potentially attracting enemies.
2. **Luckbreaker Elixir**: Instantly reverses a failed roll or action but causes minor confusion afterward.
3. **Chaos-vision Potion**: Grants true sight for one minute, but afterward makes everything appear distorted for five minutes.
