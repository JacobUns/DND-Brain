## The Last Bed
A tavern at the end of a road to nowhere specific. The last stop in the known and explored world. It is owned by [[Mirella & Sylas]], who run it as a front for their nefarious activities. As a location where adventurers and travellers stop after pilfering the ruins of the northern provinces, the couple have taken to stealing items from their tenants as they stay.

It is the work place of [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] and the home of [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]].
