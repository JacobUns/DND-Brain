# About
Also known as the Court Under the Stars, Ellerythia is the seat of power to the Eladrin people of the [[Aurora'lyn]].

Following the [[Vale Sundering]], the city has become mostly abandoned. Two monumental builds stand tall over the remainder of the city. One, the [[#Palace]], a resplendent castle structure with curved architecture in elegant lines which almost feel crystalline in nature. The other, a [[#Golden Dome]], almost alien in appearance against the rest of a city made of marble and pale stone.
# Locations
## Palace
Formerly home to the court and royal family of [[Araleth Sylvari|Sylvari]], the [[#Palace]] is a beautiful structure designed centuries before the [[Vale Sundering]] and added to by the most skilled of architects and artisans over the years.
## Golden Dome
Seemingly made of solid gold, this structure standing taller than the palace by a significant margin. At 300m high and 600m in diameter, the structure towers ominously over the rest of the city and can be seen from almost all points. Within it, a sea of golden liquid swirls and holds the wraithlike visages of the [[Aurora'lyn]] people.
