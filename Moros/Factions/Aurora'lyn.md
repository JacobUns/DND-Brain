# About
The Aurora'lyn are an Elvish people based in the [[Feywild|Fey]] Realm of [[Moros]]. During the sundering, the Aurora'lyn put the city of [[Ellerythia]] into a time stasis to ensure their survival.

They created all sorts of technologies in a dynasty that spanned thousands of years before their war with the [[Xinderoth]] tore their lands apart 4444 years ago.
