[[Fornalth, Victor & Yonrick|Fornalth]] confirms that [[Croesus]] & the interrogator aren't under the control of the creature hiding under the encampment.

The group get [[Fornalth, Victor & Yonrick]] to lure [[Croesus]] to the barn they are hiding in while the group set a trap for him. A lone knight ends up staggering towards the barn. As it enters, [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] tackles him and the body hits the floor, but the head lands separately. The group recognise the face as [[Fornalth, Victor & Yonrick|Fornalth]]. [[Arabella]] closes the barn door hurriedly and locks the group in accidentally. [[Croesus]] phases through the wall, and tells the group to leave them to their work or die.

The group engage him, and a prolonged fight ensues. Eventually, [[Croesus]] gets overwhelmed and starts to give up information on what's been happening. He claims he found the creature now referred to as [[Shelldrick]] when it was the size of a regular crab, and that it had communicated with him telepathically. From that moment on they had been inseparable and had spent decades together. The creature started to grow exponentially as it was fed, and as time went on, would require larger and larger sources of food. The caves under the cathedral had become a convenient place to hide, but overtime [[Shelldrick]] grew to a size that meant it couldn't leave the caves without being discovered. The creature had told him it was not of this plane, and was trying to grow strong enough that it could return. The plan was nearing its conclusion, and [[Shelldrick]] was finally strong enough. Finally, he explains that [[High Priest Torrezard]] has been fattened to ultimately be fed to [[Shelldrick]] and the time had finally arrived.

Convinced that the group knew they had to act, [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] plunges the dagger into [[Croesus]] and drains him of all life. The group make a hasty expedition towards the cathedral.
