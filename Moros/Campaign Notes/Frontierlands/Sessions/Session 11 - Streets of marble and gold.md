Smooth marble streets. The structures are made in curving architectures, glowing faintly with light and covered in precious stones.

Two buildings stand above all others, one looks familiar to [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]]; The royal courts. The other is a giant golden dome that stands above the courts. It's strange that this would be created in challenge to the courts.

Everything is a pristine condition as it was at the time of the [[Aurora'lyn]]. Fountains continue to spew water, the streets are clean, plants are maintained, but no life moves within the city.

Arrive at a thorough fair 600m away from the palace. White and Gold banners gently flow with the breeze. An apple stall stands covered in ripe apples, one of which [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] eats, sweet and slightly tart. It leads from the gatehouse to the golden dome building in a straight line. It seems to be built of pure gold, shimmering in the sunlight. It seems to radiate warmth from the structure itself, almost as if it's alive. The almighty towers of the palace loom over the thoroughfare. The banners have runes covering them, a language similar but not quite the same. It seems to be some kind of temporary signposting for some grand event. It would have attracted people from all over the city and is directing people somewhere.

Murals and carvings adorn the walls of buildings, and as we walk through open plaza's we hear a noise about halfway. It seems to be the first noise since entering the area. It's like something made of stone has just fallen apart 50m away. The air is thick with unnatural stillness with the only sound being distant wind. An unsettling scrape on the ground behind us on the main thoroughfare reveals an unfathomable creature. A glimmer of teeth like broken glass, slithering, unnaturally smooth. It's the size of a small cart with dark skin, a mouth of a gaping void big enough to swallow a full human in place of its chest. It slowly slithers towards us.

During combat, the creature lets out a guttural screams and a flesh coloured tendril with a vaguely human hand on its end shoots out at [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] but fails to make contact. It emits a puff of spores that is somewhat reminiscent of those emitted from [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]]'s body that then float around the creature in a 20ft radius. It shoots a barbed dart at [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]], and [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] invokes one of his Cloud Runes to reflect the damage back before it strikes. It lets out another puff, and the cloud grows to 30ft. After the creature falls, the spore cloud remains in the area.

The group retreats from the cloud, towards the noise of crumbling rock. We reach a small garden square with a mile of rubble, which may at one time have been a fountain. Water is on the floor around it, but strangely the stone appears to have been smaller than the required size to hold the water. The stone appears to have been disturbed by something recently, and it appears the creature may have emerged from the fountain, leaving its rubble behind.

The remaining walk to the golden dome is uneventful. As we approach there is a large arched entryway at the top of a grand set of stairs. Up the stairs and through the arch, it becomes clear that the dome is actually a complete sphere with half of it underground. 600m in diameter, it holds golden liquid that gently shimmers at the edge. There is no source of light inside, yet the liquid almost appears to reflect light from the dome above. Under the surface, shadows reflect from the deep. Like pale wraiths suspended in amber, faces of the elven people look back at the group. These aren't echos, but souls of the elven people. [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] attempts to put his sword's tip in the liquid and vapours attempt to grab onto it and pull the sword into the depths. He pulls it back.

[[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] calls out "Is anything listening? Can you respond?". Soft whispers, like layered voices of souls call out. Like echos of voices from my ancestors, they sound desparate, anguished. It's deafening for [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], and a voice full of sadness asks "are you one of us? are you lost like us?". There's a cocofanee of voices. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] asks how am I to return you the voice says "just join us, physically". [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] teaters of the edge of stepping forward, but through a force of will pulls himself away. As [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] explains, a voice comes from behind the group and says "I wouldn't do that if I were you." A man, standing at the top of the stairs at the entryway has appeared. "You've come far", he says. His face young but wise, robes that ripple almost like light, like they've been spun from dawn itself. He stands with a look of sorrow.

He claims to offer truth, understanding, and the power to set right what has been left to wither. He claims it is not a grave, but a triumph of will and wisdom and are waiting for the group. He says to call him [[Y'thallor]]. He says we are the first to have arrived since the [[vale sundering]]. He offers his hand to [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]], but he has no physical form. A conduit and voice for those in the sea of golden liquid. He claims that the sanctum of the unfettering is on the other side of this chamber, and houses a conduit to release the [[Aurora'lyn]]. The people of the [[Aurora'lyn]] entered knowing one must be left. One stayed behind, known as the Dreamweaver. Through pains and difficulties, he prepared his body and though the Dreamweaver survived the [[vale sundering]], he changed his mind, and did not release the people.

The sanctum is where the people of the [[Aurora'lyn]] gave up their physical form.
To release the pool by standing in the conduit, offering their soul as a bridge to allow the flood of souls to leave. Upon leaving, the physical forms will be reformed. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] attempts to tell whether [[Y'thallor]] is being truthful. He intuits that something is being withheld. He claims he cannot leave the area, as he is mearly a projection of the collective consciousnesses of the [[Aurora'lyn]].

The group travel around the back of the dome and find the Sanctum of the Unfettering. Inside, a colossal ring stands in the middle. It's structure has veins of golden material that shifts through it. A gate of light seems to shine from within.

[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]], right at the back of the group entering the sanctum, hears a figure moving and turns to look. A terrible figure stands right in front of him. Once [[Aurora'lyn]], he is no longer. His robes hang in tatters and are fused to his flesh. His limbs are extended, and veins of gold pulse beneath the surface. The left side of his skull is gone, with only crackling light pulsing within. His single remaining eye shines with blue light in an unrelenting gaze. The air trembles with power. He reaches out and hold [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s shoulder saying "Not a step further". He claims he was meant to go with them, but he stayed and saw what his people had become. They were not the [[Aurora'lyn]]. Something waits in the deep, having become them. His hands crackle and pop with electricity and he attacks the group.

[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] slashes at the humanoid creature, and when he strikes it the dagger he's holding starts glowing red hot and takes minor damage. The Xintharis dagger speaks to [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s mind saying to use the pain and tests [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s will. A force within [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] causes an intense burst of pain but he feels pleasure with it at the same time. The creature staggers back showing some look of pain itself.

[[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] talks to the creature and it recognises him as one of the [[Aurora'lyn]]. He claims it was a mistake, when the last of the [[Aurora'lyn]] entered the sea something waiting int the sea of gold had already slipped in. Parasitic, it took over their essence. If the Dreamweaver would have let them out, then whatever is trapped within the sea would have escaped. It is hungry and consumes without prejudice and reap disaster on the world. He claims the aberration we fought was one of his creations.

After discussing, we agree we are going to leave the plane. First, we are to explore the palace, then to question the shard of the Aurora, then return to the [[material plane]]. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] finds a circlet and a mantle in the throne room and brings it back to the group handing it over to [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] as the rightful heir of the bloodline.

[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] has an uneasy sleep. His nightmares are haunted by the dagger, Xintheris, being weighed down deeper than a sense of exhausion. "Did you think you were rid of us [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]?". The dagger hovers in the darkness of the abyss. "You abandoned power, but power has not abandoned you.". A shadow writhes against the material of the dagger. "You think yourself whole, then why do I remain?". Something attempts to grasp at [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s soul and he jolts awake. He looks around and notes that the red velvet chaise that he was sleeping on and finds the material slightly charred.

[[Arabella]]'s herbology book is partially translated by [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]]. There are some descriptions of flora written in poetic and meandering prose. It helps understand some of the realm's forna. Aluna's Kiss, the nectar of which can slow aging. Gleemroot, mark trails that can be seen in moonlight. Tremorbeem, natural anesthetic. The [[Aurora'lyn]] used herbology in ways unknown to others. "When the last of the Auroraâ€™lyn falls, so too will the great gardens wither. The land will be left barren, the soil forever bereft of its voice". (Notes to be sent to Martin)

[[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], entering trance, finds his sleep disturbed by distant voices. Shapes emerge from around him, [[Aurora'lyn]] in silks of their ancient kin. His mother appears to him, claiming he can save him. He sees further familiar faces, calling to him as he has forsaken them. He pushes from his mind as much as he can.

The dawn isn't celebrated by birdsong, but is met with a screeching noise as the crystalline glass of the windows explode in on us. Gusts, fragments and flakes of gold litter the floor. An amalgamation of glass stands at the entrance to the chamber which the group sleeps in. It's a humanoid figure, made up of cracked blackened glass like shattered mirrors. It glows faintly with a sickly light which appears to hold it together. It stands, almost panting. It moves its head, and though transparent it appears to be looking at us threateningly.
