> [!note] Retcon
> This session retcons some of the previous session to expand the concepts previously encountered by the party. The beginning of this session starts before fighting the shadowy figures and gaining access to the rainbow path

At the library, a shard of technology from the [[Aurora'lyn]] speaks to the group. An excerpt from it's communication is below:

"Welcome seeker... stewards of the natural & arcane. Bound by the aurora... The [[Xinderoth]] trespassed into their realm. People of darkness... Lands turned to ash & magma. The shadow wars. Fought with weapons made of rock"

[[Xinderoth]] ruins in the material plane are those with buildings rumoured to have been made from living rock.

The dream stasis was created to allow the people of the [[Aurora'lyn]] not to experience time and age while their realm recovers, and the effects would fade once it had. There were rumours that the knowledge of this capability had been shared.

The Aurora Path is a transport system designed by the [[Aurora'lyn]]. The statues of the heroes of the [[Aurora'lyn]] that have been seen by the party and were known to [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] are keys to the use of the path. Each is a representation of a value of the culture. To use the path, you must find the Colossi in the fey realm, one that shares the same energy as the [[Aurora'lyn]] must attune to the heart of the hero and demonstrate the associated value.

The values are: Courage, Vision, Harmony, Hope & Creativity

[[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] tries to connect with the shard from the library & feels it pull but fails to connect with it. [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] attempts to connect with it & after initially failing, he catches it as it falls with his food & it bounces back into the air where it holds in place. It calls the process described above the "Ritual of Activation".

The group find one of the statues in the clearing of the forest broken into pieces. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] attempts to approach, touch the stone chest and feel the harmony of nature around him but fails to connect with the heart of the colossus. The group make several attempts, eventually feeling like there's something in the way that's making it too difficult to connect to the heart. [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] manages to figure out that the chest is hollow with the tree growing from it and his gentle striking of the stone. He reaches out to the tree and convinces it to move. It slides over, revealing the hollow nature to the rest of the group.

[[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] starts to dig to widen the gap, but takes some time. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] uses mold earth to speed up the process and [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] believes the rapid increase in the shifting of soil is his doing. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] congratulates [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]]'s effort and thanks him. The shifted earth reveals an orb previously hidden. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] again tries to connect with the orb and without warning the world shifts around the group as the colossus reforms and the chest within which we stand starts to rise into the air. In connecting with the orb, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] closes awareness of his surroundings.

As things start to settle, others attempt to connect with the orb but are flung outward from it. [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]], who is stood closest to the door, is flung out into the air 120ft above the ground. Trees break is fall, and after taking some damage collects himself. The rest of the group, excluding [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], can see black figures carrying torches and shadowy hounds howling as they make their way towards the colossus. The group their supplies together and tie a rope long enough to reach the ground. [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] starts to climb, but is set upon by the figures, one of which teleports up to [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] and cuts the rope, bringing them both to the ground. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], who comes aware during this period, turns into a Giant Spider and, with [[Arabella]] on his back, climbs down the side to try and rescue [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] while [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] and [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] come down the rope slowly.

The seven Shadowbound figures engage the group, two of them in the fray while the remaining group circle the fight and seem to chant wordlessly. Oddly, they all look exactly the same facially. The hounds are starting to fall, and one Shadowbound figure lays prone bloodied, before one of the other chanting figures steps into the fray and shouts "Cease this violence". The group tensely hold for any sign of aggression, while the figure tears the head off the body on the floor & claims that they are the same person and had followed us through the gate. He asks whether we are allied with the [[Aurora'lyn]] and, before much conversation happens, decides we must be enemies & makes an aggressive action. The colossus, inert to this point, suddenly seems to hum and an arcane explosion pushes outwards from it, immediately killing two of the Shadowbound. The remaining five flee.

Confused, the group return to the relative safety of the colossus. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], still in spider form, covers the entryway in web to ensure no one accidentally gets flung out again and nothing can get it. The group rest until morning. In the morning, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] tries again to connect to the orb &, though he feels he is more connect to the world than ever before, can't connect with it. [[Arabella]] suggests that there may be a potion they can make that puts the drinker into the state necessary to connect with it. Together with [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]]'s help, she brews something to enable [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] to enter the state necessary.

For the first time, something of the [[Aurora'lyn]] responds. It says that the group carries with it an a shadow artefact, Xintheris, Shadow fang of the [[Xinderoth]], and that we cannot enter or stay here lest it undo everything we are attempting. After a short altercation between [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] & [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]], the dagger, acquired from Dody's house, is flung into the forrest below.

Finally, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] is able to commune with the heart orb. Each of the groups vision is suddenly overcome with scenes that relate to each in challenge. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] sees [[Ellerythia]] before the sundering. The scene fractures & voices tell [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] to mend the song of the [[Aurora'lyn]]. After an initial struggle succeeds to weave the strands of the song back together. [[Arabella]] sees the growth of her plants, [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] the illusory figures similar to those of his dreams connected to the dagger, [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] sees a canyon path he must traverse to get back to his companions, and [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] sees reflections of himself & must find the one he believes to be most true to himself.

Finally, after all challenges are successful, the paths open onto the rainbow path of the Aurora. The area opens to a crystaline world of pure light with a path that seems to run forever. Then suddenly, it ends. The group lands softly on the streets of [[Ellerythia]].
