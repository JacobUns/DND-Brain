The group stand in the chamber of the temple, [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]] having fled, the wall covered in roots which have seemingly parted to reveal a shimmering gateway. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] pushes his head through and finds an entirely different location on the other side in a different time of day.He sees a giant tree standing in the distance.

[[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] walks through & the group follows. [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] goes through with the group but doesn't emerge on the other side with us. A small panic ensues as [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] realises he has lost his father again. Five sprite, that [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] recognises as Briarthorn Sprites and usually harmless, float by in the near-distance. As they come closer, he sees they have mutated and look scarred with growths. They carry pikes and lunge at the group, cackling demonically. [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] & [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] grapple one sprite with whip and harpoon and tear it in half. As it tears, two other sprites cackle & float into the fight. [[Arabella]] stabs a syringe into [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s arse & injects some strange liquid she has concocted and he suddenly starts spewing dragonfire at the sprites. The remaining sprites flee into the forest.

[[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] uses the surroundings to figure out roughly the group's location. They're south of the areas he grew up & lived through his early life before appearing in the [[material plane]]. Ancient moss covered stones lie all around, vines creeping over their surface.

Suddenly, [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]] stumbles into the group, a look of madness in his eyes. He's covered in the same growths as the sprites. He says he's been lost in here for years. [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] slaps him & is confronted by a demonic voice. Panicked, [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] punches [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]] knocking him unconscious. As he falls, he reveals a giant throbbing mass of fungus on his neck. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], with a high medicine check, identifies that if we remove the growth it would kill [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]]. As the group stands, inspecting the fallen man, he lets out a choking noise and, with a puff of spores, his mouth explodes with a fungal vine, falling still.

Not wanting to get too close to the vine, the group backs off and travels north, eventually coming across part of a granite statue in a clearing. It seems to have millennia of wear and grime covering it. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] recognises it as one of the warrior statues of the [[Aurora'lyn]], the civilisation of the Eladrin he comes from. The warriors are all depictions of heroes of the Eladrin people.

As the group stands in the clearing, inspecting the chunk of granite, mists start to surround the clearing and a voice starts whispering of damnation. From the mist, a spectral figure attacks the group, it's unnatural movement graceful and terrifying in equal parts. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] pulls the dagger & it glows with dark light. The spectre refers to it as "Netherbane". [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] uses his wooden arm to punch the creature, finding it effective as a magical weapon. The spectre advances on [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]], missing with two attacks, and restrains him with its tendrils. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] whispers into its mind & forces it to run, hitting it with the dagger in the process. It explodes with light & Victors eyes start to glow with the same light as the dagger.

The group rest for the night in a hut summoned by [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]. During [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]]'s watch, a figure, 40ft away, walks past the group's camouflaged sleeping location. 40ft in height, its form is massive and treelike, and [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] recognises it as an Ent-like being. In [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s watch, he sees what be believes to be his father's medallion hanging from one of the trees which [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] collects in the morning.

As the groups rest ends and they emerge from the shelter, the mists around them have remained and from the dark edges the group hears howls. Shadowy hounds set upon the group and are quickly dispatched. The group, recovering and catching their breathe after the encounter, hear a noise nearby and ready themselves. Strangely, [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] greets [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] and says he left the medallion on the tree for him to find, believing it would stop his death. He explains the skeleton seen by [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]] was his but from some time into the future. [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] turns and calls into the forest for someone to join him, and, strangely, a younger [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] meets him, wearing a less worn and shinier medallion.
