We start at the [[Pefergee#The Last Bed|Last Bed]]. The accounting has started, a time where farmers and merchants in the city of [[Pefergee]].

A highly useless young Dwarf called Dody Bandervelt inheritted responsibility for the largest farm in [[Pefergee]]. He's known for being very charismatic but with a reputation for running up loans with people. He made his money farming broad beans. As food starts to come out of the kitchen, he stands on a table and proclaims that [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] has made a new recipe with the lentils he produces.

A tense conversation with the alderman kicks up as Dody says he doesn't even like broad beans and wants to grow red split peas instead. He grumbles that his cousin from [[Bavaria]] grows them and they provide people much more energy. Dody approaches a Dwarf he calls [[Brannick Coldrock]] for help, having bought the red split peas and having no broad beans. He implies he's going to steal the beans and that negotiations would be happening with weapons instead.

[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] questions occasional travellers returning from the north as they return to the tavern. None of them have heard anything about his father, [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]], who went north some time ago and hasn't made his return.

Following up on Dody's approach of [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]], the group head to Dody's farm and find that he has already taken delivery of the red split peas. In searching for Dody, the group find two wild boar partly devouring the body of a boy. The group recognise it as Porentina, a farm hand. After quickly dispatching the boars in a fight that saw a fire accidentally set within a barn by [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] puts the fire out using the corpse of one of the boar, slamming it into the fire until it is dimmed.

They eventually find Dody within the barn, where he is mourning over spoilt seed that has been delivered. He tells the group he wishes to steal the produce of [[Tourelle]] to replace his rotten goods. While discussions happen, arrows thump into the barn. The group prepare themselves and hide as a tall and dark haired human enters and appears to ransack the place. The group make themselves visible as he finds Dody's safe. The man identifies himself as Antonio, and claims that something of his was stolen. Dody opens the safe. Inside are several items, but one catches [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]]'s attention. A dagger with an ornate handle baring a red gemstone. Dody, pulling the dagger from the safe, attempts to stab the man, but [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] is able to react fast enough, pinning the man to the wall with an Entangle spell. The man attempts to leave with the dagger, which he claims belongs to him, but is stopped by the group. Instead of dropping the item, he instead throws it at Dody, still attached to the wall, but misses. The group take the dagger, finding justification in it not belonging to Dody, but in taking it Dody becomes enraged and attempts to attack the group for it. In the scuffle, Dody is stabbed with the dagger and it appears to drain the life force from him with black markings appearing on his skin. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] is the one that ends up keeping hold of the dagger.

The group beat a hasty retreat back to [[Pefergee]] to inform the sheriff. They find the sheriff appearing quite restless, on edge, shifty and reserved and after informing him of the goings on at the farm, discuss going to see the alderman. The sheriff quickly stops them suspiciously and without real explanation. The group infer that the alderman and sheriff must be romantically involved. Not knowing where else to go, the group return to [[Pefergee#The Last Bed|the Last Bed]].
