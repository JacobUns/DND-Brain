Time runs on, and after a short period the alderman joins the group. He tells them of gossip that one of the men that lives on the edge of [[Pefergee]], named Clenrick Pertwhistle, has gone missing. He's a short, skinny farmhand who was last seen in [[Pefergee#The Last Bed|the Last Bed]]. There are also rumours of an attack last night on goats in the middle of the night by winged & scaled creatures. The alderman says there is a need for an extra night watch, and that there is payment of 1 silver piece per night to any man or woman willing to assist.

[[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]] pulls [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] aside and tells him that Clenrick owes her 30 gold pieces. If he doesn't have the gold, then [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] is told to find a disc shaped item carved with symbols that for some reason he feels are familiar to him. [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]] provides [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] a drawing for reference. #quest

The group sign up to help with the night watch and assemble at the sheriff's office. The sheriff leads a patrol out, and establishes watch positions, before [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] finds a body with a drakelike creature crouching over it. The group fight two Heendrills, and through the fight a couple are affected by their screeches and poison from their bites causing paralysis. A dark cloaked figure comes through the gates and offers his aid, providing potions and treatments to those affected. He introduces himself as [[Tannentraus]], a forest ranger from the east coast of the lake at Glenn Ard. The Rangers of Glenn Ard are responsible for caring for the creatures of the forest there, and he has been tracking these Heendrills which he claims were a mother and father pair searching for food as their habitat and associated territory were under threat from a group known as the [[Knights of Arduum]].

[[Tannentraus]] explains that the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] have been culling Heendrills and other creatures of the forest and that all of his brethren have been killed attempting to defend their forest charges. He believes they may continue to chase him to cover up the atrocities.

He requests we go and speak to the High Priest of the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]]. He informs us the closest town to the Knight's encampment is [[Tourelle]] and provides us the name of a tavern there we can stay at called the [[Tourelle#Wet Whistle Tavern|Wet Whistle Tavern]]. The group agrees to go and investigate and heads out for [[Tourelle]].

After arriving at the [[Tourelle#Wet Whistle Tavern|Wet Whistle Tavern]], the group starts to gather information on the [[Knights of Arduum]]. We find out that they've been taking over for the last six weeks and have become violent. We're told we can find the High Priest in the Frindharben "Cathedral", which is the largest of the tents in the semi-temporary encampment.

As the group enters the area they find themselves surrounded by figures going about their business in pairs, each one wearing a full face black mask that covers their features entirely. The group find their way to the massive tent in the centre of the camp and are greeted by a man not wearing a mask who introduces himself as [[Croesus]], an admin at the Cathedral. The group says they're there to see the high priest, and are led to a table at the heart of the tent. Behind it is the grotesque sight of a hairless and obese man, naked from the waste down and sat on a trough of excrement. The group challenge the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] purpose being in the area, and ask their intent. They claim they are "purging the heathen world" and that they "will keep going until all emotion is destroyed".

Two guards appear in front of the group, blocking their exit, alongside the admin [[Croesus]]. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] Fey Steps to the guards and charms them both, allowing the group to beat a hasty escape.
