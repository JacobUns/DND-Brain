[[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]] leads the group into a room, and without thinking [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] brings in the bag of stolen goods, which he's chastised for by [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]]. [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] takes & up ends the bag on the table. All manner of items tumble out including:
- A silver goblet with liquid on its side but not spilling
- A disc with runes matching the drawing previously given to [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] by [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]]
- A bronze medallion [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] recognises as his father's
- A sheath of black material that seems to magnetically attract to the dagger being carried by [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]].

[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] asks about the medallion as [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] steals the disc and hides it. [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]] explains they stole it from someone three weeks ago who was heading north. He was wearing a black cloak and seemed to be a loner. He reportedly had stayed at the tavern four times in the last six months, and wasn't [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]].

[[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] lifts the goblet and takes a sip. The liquid is freezing cold but the temperature of the goblet doesn't reflect this. The liquid seems thicker than water but appears to have no ill effects on [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]].

[[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] demands no more stealing from [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]], who lies and agrees. The group go their separate ways for the night, and, in his rooms, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] investigates the disc. It appears to be made of a rare metal & wood and has a strange resonance that feels like [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] once could attune to it but can't appear to at the moment.

In the morning, the group reassembles at [[Pefergee#The Last Bed|the Last Bed]] to discuss the recent goings on. As they gather, a knock comes from the door and the Sheriff enters. He questions us about the [[Pefergee#Pertwhistle Farm|Pertwhistle Farm]] encounter having visited the farm. As he does, the Sheriff spots a diamond necklace hanging from [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]]'s pocket which he has stolen from the bag of goods.

[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] asks [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]] whether the Sheriff knows about the operation they're running, and she explains that the Alderman knows. [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] claims he hid the other bodies in several locations, including a hole in the forest. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] decides to spend some time with the medallion, which is from his father's Archeological Society, and investigates it for arcane forces. He finds it is not magical. Though the blade he carries is also now within a sheath, it appears to continue to talk telepathically to [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]].

Later that day, the group find the Sheriff and Alderman arguing and overhear the statement "you can't found a town base on those principles!" As the group goes about their night talking, a dark cloaked figure enters with dark hair and a beard. He says to [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] that he's seen his father. [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]] & [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] are nowhere to be found, but their things are still in their quarters so [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] assumes they'll return.

The Dark cloaked figure says he's going north in two days time and would take [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] explains to the Sheriff everything they encountered at the farm, and the Sheriff is convinced by the Alderman, begrudgingly, and the two go their separate ways.

The figure joins the groups table, and introduces himself as [[Sandun Siwan]]. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] shows the medallion to [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]] who claims it was found on a skeleton in a ruin to the north. He goes on to explain that there are rumours that thousands of years ago, an ancient civilisation lived in the forest. Their ruins hold ancient magic, traps and curses. The [[Moon Church]] are looking for something there & claiming land. He explains they are warrior priests and aggressive in nature, defending what's theirs with force.

He agrees to take us north, and explains we'll need rations for two weeks. The travel will be 100 miles in a small boat initially, then a day's trek to reach the area being investigated by the [[Moon Church]]. He explains he has connections in the Thieves Guild of [[Lashen]], and that his father was an archeologist who dedicated his life to studying the ancient runes of [[Anampur]]. He has always sold the items he's found and has a reputation to maintain, but ultimately wants to be known as the best of all time.

The group set off north in the morning. The boat trip is uneventful, and eventually they see a wooden post with a skeleton attached to it. The group moor up and climb the bank and a small cliff edge, but inadvertently run into a giant cobra. After a short fight, the group continue on their trek. After the day's travel and resting, the group, led by [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]] eventually reach a fallen stone temple covered in Ivy. There is writing on it that matches that of the disc. Priests of the [[Moon Church]] surround an alter covered in offerings, and yet more are found encamped and guarding the temple.

[[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] casts Pass Without a Trace and the group starts to skirt around the camp to see if they can find another entrance. The temple goes underground & the group ends up above the entrance. Following a long and shallow trench in the ground, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] eventually leads the group along its path where they find an enormous tree with no visible roots.  [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] digs around the edge of the tree and suddenly the earth gives way. He falls 80ft to the ground below as the rest of the group backs up. Carefully, everyone climbs down to [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] where they find what appears to be an atrium with many doors & a main corridor leading back in the direction of the entrance.

The group follows the corridor and eventually find light near some stairs with scraping noises coming from below. Venturing down, the group finds a room with three cloaked figures, two in white and one in brown. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] recognises the brown cloaked figure as his father. [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] tries to talk to the monks, and they immediately draw their weapons and attack. The group realise that [[Sandun Siwan|Sandun]] is nowhere to be found and has left them.

The fight concludes with [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] crushing the head of one monk while [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] knocks the other unconcious with a rock. Oddly, [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] still has his medallion & [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] oddly looks more warn. [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] says he's been trying to infaltrate the [[Moon Church]] to make a discovery that would shape the world for centuries to come. He was taken captive & managed to convince them he could help them find something called the synapse room. He says the building is alive and was grown, and that the [[Moon Church]] were looking to find this technology.

The wall [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] has been scraping has has a circle of runes that [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] recognises from the disc and the temple. [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] clears the remaining contents off the wall and [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], which the rest of the group discuss the finding, walks over and places his hand over the imprint. Suddenly, the wall starts to shift and light up as the runes rotate. The wall disappears, and a gate of light is revealed.
