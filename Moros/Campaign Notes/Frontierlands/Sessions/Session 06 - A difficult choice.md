The group wakes in unfamiliar surroundings. Several of the group try to remember what happened to get them there and have bleary memories of being on a battlefield with [[Shelldrick]] bursting out of the ground.

Each member has had shackles attached to them and have chains running to the walls behind them. The walls seem to be some kind of a volcanic rock, and, strangely, when [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] Fey Steps to a location 30ft away finds he is still bound but that the chains have extended. He finds himself at bars to a cell, and after wildshaping is able to slip through the bars and finds a corridor that disappears off. Not wanting to leave his companions he comes back and explains what he's seen. After some further time trying to free themselves, [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] realises he has different memories to others.

[[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] recounts his memory of fighting [[Shelldrick]] and explains that a portal opened that seemed to such the group into another plane. A group of sorcerers & wizards came through other portals into the plane and had helped to fight the creature, killing it, before ultimately turning on the group.

As the group waits, a whispy ethereal creature in black robes walking on hands & feet approaches. It moves unnaturally and slips through the bars to the cage in a way that almost makes it seem as if its bones had to break or dislocate to squeeze through the gap. Terrified, the group scramble to protect themselves before quickly being returned back to a sleeping state. When they wake, the creature eventually returns but this time asks for patience and says they are trying to figure out how to get us home.

On the third visit, they claim that [[Shelldrick]] was a creature called an Ünderlothgar, which had been believed to be extinct for a billion years. As the group talks to the mysterious cloaked figure, they realise it's made up of arachnid-like eye ball creatures. One detaches itself from the body of the creature and climbs onto [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]]. Some panic ensues as the creature merges with [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]]'s flesh and gives him an eye, which moves of its own accord watching its surroundings.

The whispy creature leads the group to a stepped pyramid in which the group find an audience chamber with eight other figures in the same robes. They ask for a part of one of us, with approximately the weight of a head, to figure out how to send us home. Initially believing they're joking, the group comes to find that they seriously require flesh matter of one of us as a means of divining which plane we originate from.

Eventually, [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] volunteers reluctantly as no one else is willing to. The creatures promise they will replace whatever is given and so [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]], using his side sword, cuts off [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]]'s arm just above the elbow. The creatures pull back their hoods, revealing smooth sphere heads of varying colours. They introduce themselves as [[The Hive]], and say their forebears had a great war against the Ünderlothgar which they believed they had won after erasing them from time, and so were suspicious to find us fighting one. [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]]'s arm is replaced with something that resembles a wooden material, but is grown from the stump which remains.

[[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]]'s arm is enough for the group to divine the location the group originate from and they are transported back. The group finds themselves in the remains of the burning templar grounds and, on return to [[Tourelle]], are chased out of town.

A week in [[Pefergee]] passes, during which [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] overhears an argument between [[Mirella & Sylas]], where [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] says he "got rid of them in the old abandoned well on the other side of the forest". Concerned and curious in equal parts, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] investigates and finds a body of a 50ish human male.

[[Tannentraus]] comes to the group with [[Clarissa Fowls]] and they explain the fate of her son. [[Tannentraus]] explains something taking the groups image is attacking farms and sucking the blood from animals. The group analyse the patterns of the attacks and suspect the next farm to be attacked is the [[Pefergee#Pertwhistle Farm|Pertwhistle Farm]]. The group travel there, and find a grim scene of blood and sword marks. On investigation, the group finds [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] in the loft who says he came to rob the adventurers that returned recently but found on had killed the other six & [[Mirella & Sylas|sylas]] then killed him in self defence. He claimed the man actued like he was possessed. After killing him, [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] took all the belongings back to the last bed.

The group lets [[Mirella & Sylas|sylas]] go so they can prepare for the creature's attack. The group set an ambush at farm's barn, with [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] acting as bait in the form of a goat. After a short battle, the party kills the shapeshifter as it changes into forms of the party, including [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s father [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] and [[Shelldrick]].

The party takes the corpse back to the Sheriff looking for a reward, and then head back to [[Pefergee#The Last Bed|the Last Bed]] to find [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]]. As they enter, the group find [[Mirella & Sylas|Mirella]] waiting as [[Mirella & Sylas|Sylas]] closes the door behind them.
