Young [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] claims he & [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] have already met in [[Pefergee]] while [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] was drunk. [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] claims he was only born a few years before [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] on a small farmstead in [[Pefergee]]. He became an archaeologist, found the temple & gate, went through and found the [[Aurora'lyn]]. He informs the group that there is temporal displacement as you traverse. He also tells the group that [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] is adopted, and claims the old and young planned this meeting.

After further conversation, the group starts to get frustrated that [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] refuses to give us specific information or explain why we become upset with him in the future. We go our separate ways, but before we part [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] gives [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] a clock like object that he claims can measure temporal displacement. When we entered, he claims that we only slipped by 1.5hrs but that this was likely the cause of [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] slipping 4632 years into the future. Oddly, members of the group start discussing cutting Earlians dick off to see if it affects the timeline, before remembering that [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] was adopted.

Finally, just before parting, older [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] suggests to [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] that he reveal to the group what he really looks like. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] appears not to know what he's talking about, and young [[Earlian Dimmelwald|Earlian]] realises that the timeline appears to be different. Hurriedly, the two rush off leaving the group confused.

The party continue north and notice that the fungus has attached to living matter but not to rock or other kinds of matter. We assume that the fungus is parasitic in nature. We come to the edge of the forest and find a wide open plains with a hole approximately 1km in diameter stretching across a large part of it. Carefully, the group approaches the edge of the hole and in the centre. The tree is enormous, but the hole is deep enough that the leaves don't even reach top. From the edge, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] sees and reads a huge rune that seems to be carved into the side and is able to understand it as the word for "Knowledge". [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]], who is creating a map as we walk, marks the location and we continue around the edge of the hole. As we do, we find another rune carved on the western face which reads as "History". As we continue we find the Northern face says "Preserve" and, finally, on the Eastern face another that reads "Library".

On the northern edge of the hole the group find a four meter square tile that has the rune for "Blood" engraved on it. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] cuts the back of his hand and the tile starts to rumble. Again, [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] notices runes have appeared, and they indicate an invisible bridge. Without much explanation, he steps off the edge and his foot meets solidity. As he gets further out, the rest of the group follow and the group continue towards the tree. Strangely, though, as the group moves onwards they find that the bridge starts to slope down, but gravity seems to shift with it keeping the groups feet firmly on the surface. Eventually, the group reaches the tree, and as [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] reaches out to touch it the bark seems to morph over his skin. He pushes through and the group find themselves in an empty room.

When the party leave the edge of the room, it seems to act as a lift which raises the party to a cavernous magical environment. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] walks up one path and finds a mostly empty space with a well ahead. The well connects to those that sit at the seating surrounding it and tells the party of some of the history of the space. It explains that 4444 years ago, and event called the "[[Vale Sundering]]" forced those living in the [[Feywild]] to go into stasis.

The voice explains that the sundering was caused by a natural extraterrestrial event that psionically vegetated any conscious and intelligent being. It informs the group of a war in the past between the [[Aurora'lyn]] and the [[Xinderoth]], who were those that could grow structures. It also names the "Dreamwaver", and that [[Araleth]], [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]]'s father, had lived and ruled the [[Aurora'lyn]] 6000 years ago. Finally, it informs the group of pathways that can be used to travel quickly between destinations using the heroic statues of the Eladrin. We rest inside before venturing out of the tree and make our way back towards the shattered statue of the Eladrin hero to try and find the start point of the fast travel.

As we venture down the pathway, the party encounters six black cloaked humanoids. One raises its arm and says it knows we are close. [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]] calls down a Moonbeam on the cloaked figures as one fires a black bolt that resembles the light from [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] when using the Netherbane. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] stabs one with the dagger & it says "you do me great honour" as its life force is drained leaving it a husk. The youngest member drops his weapon when the battle is obviously lost. He walks towards [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] & shouts a word and [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]]'s eyes go black and stabs the boy. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] is completely unaware once the word is called to him, and comes back to consciousness after the event.

The group continues to the statue & find the feet. Investigating, we find a doorway that freely opens and reveals another gate. The party steps through & finds a path of light surrounded by prismatic light. The time displacement reader shows we've slipped by 6 hours into the future. Within the strange space is a set of pathways that lead in 7 different directions laid out before us. The group chooses the middle path.
