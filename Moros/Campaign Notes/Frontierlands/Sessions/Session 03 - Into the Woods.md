[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] casts something to emulate the sound of a Heendrill as a distraction, and the group can hear one of the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] call out "the damn thing's got out again". The group flee at full pelt through the encampment and make it out, and head towards towards the outskirts of [[Tourelle]]. On the way, an owl appears overhead and flys down towards the group. The group recognise it as ***Screech***, the companion of [[Tannentraus]]. [[Arabella]] takes a small parchment scroll from Screech's leg and the owl flies off. The scroll requests the group meet him in the basement of the Wet Whistle at dawn.

The group reach [[Tourelle]] and make their way towards another tavern, [[Tourelle#The Mermaid Tavern|the Mermaid]], to wait for the meeting. There, they learn the son of the barmaid of [[Tourelle#The Wet Whistle Tavern|the Wet Whistle]] has gone missing. The boy's name is ***Frankie***; a tall and very skinny boy in his late teens with a mop of light blonde hair. He was seen in the town centre but disappeared. There are rumours he was taken by the [[Knights of Arduum]] as they have been swarming the town recently.

The group makes their way to [[Tourelle#The Wet Whistle Tavern|the Wet Whistle]] and set up in the basement ready to meet [[Tannentraus]]. As time goes on though, he does not appear. Eventually, with a knock at the door, the group open it to find two [[Knights of Arduum]] standing before them. They make to grab the group, and after a scrap that sees the two [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] fall the group manages to fell their attackers. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] fells the last of them, but uses the dagger from ***Dody***'s to do so. He describes to the group that, with the dagger in the knight's chest, he seemed to see visions mutilated bodies in piles and that a voice had spoken to him, saying that if he follows the path the dagger provides him that power can be his.

The group leave with no sight of [[Tannentraus]], wondering whether he's set the group up or whether something happened to him. As the group attempts to leave the tavern, a group of thugs intercepts again, and, after another short scuffle where one of the thugs is taken captive, some answers start to flow. The captured man is named ***Quintus***. He claims that the group had been sent to kill us by [[Croesus]]. They'd managed to intercept the owl sent by [[Tannentraus]] and had got there first, with the reward of 20 gold pieces per body being an enticing prospect. He claims that they'd also been approached to take the boy, ***Frankie***, back to the Cathedral, but had turned this job down claiming snatching children for mysterious groups was a step too far for the group. The group ask after the High Priest and whether this would have been his order. The thug doesn't know, but gives us the name [[High Priest Torrezard|Torrezard]] for the man. After giving up what he knows the group release the man and head out of town.

Knowing [[Tannentraus]] may still be out ready to meet the group, but not feeling safe in the city, we head towards a glade in the forest previously mentioned by the Ranger on the edge of [[Tourelle]]. On our path, a young human female falls out of a tree along our path. She's wearing Hunters Garb and introduces herself as ***Collrinder***, and says she's hiding from the [[Knights of Arduum]], and hearing our approach made a too hasty attempt to hide. She tells us that the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] are raiding the forest once a fortnight and seem to take back everything they can find in the forest. As the group talk to the woman, they hear noises coming from nearby. Climbing around a cliff face, the group hide in bushes to observe the approaching people. The [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] have begun raiding again, and one pulls out an Ostrich egg sized green object that emits a bright light when activated. It releases a harmonic noise that attracts a wolf which is felled easily in one strike by a [[Knights of Arduum|Knight]].

As time goes on, and the group continue to observe the massacre of both woodland and magical creatures in the area, a massive branch flies through the trees and impails one of the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] through the chest. The group, seeing an opportunity to stop the slaughter, jump into action and attack the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]], and to their relief are greeted by [[Tannentraus]] riding an Ent which is introduced to the group as **Alfie***. Gathering and conversing, the group agree to gather more information on the encampment and, disguising themselves as [[Knights of Arduum]], tie up the slaughtered beasts, load them onto carts brought to the glade by their fallen foes, and make their way to regroup with the others.

The group manage to infiltrate the encampment with some tenseness during the trip back that almost sees the group discovered. Off a track from the central tent, the group find a massive hole has been excavated down that has infrastructure of a stairway down and a winch crane down with a large platform on one end. The group assume that this must run under the camp grounds, as the crane is being used to load the creatures from the forest onto the platform before being lowered into the depths.

In the process of scouting, the group notice that the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] appear to do everything in perfect tandem without the need to communicate their actions. Its unclear whether they are being controlled or whether they are just highly practiced and militarised. The group decide to cause a distraction to allow them to make their way down the stairs. They light multiple fires in the camp, and before long the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] are rushing to put out the blaze. As the group attempts to go down the stairs though, a guard that has not gone to fight the fires stops us. We manage to talk our way past, but in the process the guard looks to the top right corner of his eye and says "there are lots of fires" as if the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] share a consciousness.

At the bottom of the stairs, the group find 15 cells on either side of a long corridor that stems off to darkness, and after investigating find that 27 of them have been filled with creatures. The investigations are brought to a halt as a female voice speaks in each of the party's minds, and she makes clear she knows we are not under her control. With movement reminiscent of the hydraulic movement of a spiders legs, but as the creature emerges the group see that it appears to be an enormous crustacean similar to a crab. The creature reaches into a small pool of water, which seems significantly deeper than it should be at first glance, and pulls out of it the body of a boy. After brief inspection, the group realise that it is the boy, Frankie, described to them as the son of [[Tourelle#The Wet Whistle Tavern|the Wet Whistle]] tavern owner. Speaking through the boy's body, the creature requests the group fetch the High Priest and feed him to it without informing the guards.

The group, concerned at what they have found, head for the Cathedral tent. As they reach the outside, we're intercepted by [[Croesus]] who calls for guards. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]], thinking he can reason with [[High Priest Torrezard|Torrezard]] makes a dash for the area we previously met the priest. [[Arabella]] and [[Brannick Coldrock|Brannick]] immediately run the other direction and leave the camp with hast, but [[Kazak Blitzwater|Kazak]] and [[Karrik Sylvari, last of the Aurora'lyn|Karrik]], not wanting to leave [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] to his fate alone, dash in after him. Arriving at the main audience area of the Cathedral the three don't see [[High Priest Torrezard|Torrezard]]. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]], seeing another exit out the back of the room, dashes into an area that appears to be the priest's bed chamber. The priest is lying there, completely naked, and is utterly shocked that someone has entered his chamber. Believing that if he can connect with the priest's mind and speak to him directly without the influence of the creature, [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] connects telepathically to [[High Priest Torrezard|Torrezard]]. [[High Priest Torrezard|Torrezard]] does not appear to want assistance, and calls for the guards, before [[Croesus]] accompanied by [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] flood the room. Karrik, having cut a small hole in the tent at the back to allow him to see through it, prepares to attempt a getaway, but can't see a way to do so without leaving one of his friends behind. [[Croesus]] commands the group to drop their weapons, and the three sheepishly comply.
