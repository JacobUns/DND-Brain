# About
During the war between the [[Aurora'lyn]] and the [[Xinderoth]], a psionic event occurred which vegetated any sentient and conscious creature within it. This was believed to be a natural extraterrestrial event. The event occurred 4444 years before the current timeline.

The effects of the sundering are still felt in the [[Feywild]] to this day. Deformed creatures stalk the lands, scarred by wounds and pockmarked.

Caused by an alignment of the spheres, bodies of the cosmos cause a massive burst of radiation that destroys anything of intelligence. It can happen to any plane of existence, and is not isolated to the [[Feywild]].
