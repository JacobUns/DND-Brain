# Adventuring
# Craftsmanship
Guilds of people proficient in the creation of all manner of material and arcane items come together to learn from each other and to ensure a constant stream of commissions.

Typically, a guild will be commissioned to complete a job by an individual or business and the guild will assign members through their ranks to complete the work. For example, a Silversmith guild may be commissioned by a royal ambassador to create a set of rings to be bestowed to an ally as a gift. They may assign a [[Guild Structures#Senior Guild Member|Senior Member]] to design the pieces, two [[Guild Structures#Journeyman Guild Member|Journeyman Members]] to work the raw materials, and several [[Guild Structures#Apprentice Guild Member|Apprentices]] to do the mundane preparation and organisation of raw materials. All of this may then be quality controlled by a [[Guild Structures#Field Captain & Master Craftsman|Master Craftsman]] to ensure its quality before being sent by courier, organised by the [[Guild Structures#Guild Archivist|Guild Archivist]].

Alternatively, however, certain guilds may have famous members that have become world renowned. In these circumstances, premiums may be paid for the work to be completed by this member specifically, either in part or whole.

Commissions may be completable by a single guild, depending on their capabilities, but may also require guilds to collaborate on a piece. A [[#Swordsmith]], for example, may be able to forge raw metals into a bladed instrument of perfect balance, ready for war or ceremony, and have the skills to appropriately detail it with ornamentation befitting a king. A [[#Blacksmith]] may be able to be able to form the raw materials into the same shaped sword of similar balance, but is unlikely to have the skills to ornament it and would likely need a [[#Silversmith]].
## Artisan
Whether painting, framing, glassblowing, sculpting or any other artistic pursuit, an artisan's guild is a place where creative minds come together to develop their skills and find inspiration from those with more experience. [[Guild Structures#Field Captain & Master Craftsman|Masters]] of their crafts may use [[Guild Structures#Apprentice Guild Member|apprentices]] or [[Guild Structures#Journeyman Guild Member|journeymen]] to carry out their artistic vision while taking the credit for the works. This ultimately gives the less experienced craftsman opportunity to hone their crafts while being paid for the effort, though this will be much less than commission would be worth.
## Blacksmith
## Bowyer
Every ranger, hunter and military needs equipment with ranged capabilities. Bowyers are masters in crafting bows and crossbows from natural materials. Any child playing with sticks and string can make something that looks like a bow, but knowing how to get the most out of the materials to increase their power, accuracy and consistency takes a masters hand.

Craftsman following the bowyer profession may start by preparing bow strings, lengths of wood or feathers for arrows alongside the tutelage of a fletcher, then progress onto selecting and crafting staves, layering woods for better performance, and bending them into an appropriate shape to achieve a draw weight appropriate for their use. The more senior the bowyer the better performance will be achievable and the more beautiful carved wood will be to the customer.
## Carpenter
## Enchanter
## Fletcher
## Silversmith
The art of crafting jewellery and gems may be undertaken by silversmiths. Responsible for crafting many types of accessory, from necklaces to rings, they craft all manners of materials into both dainty aesthetic pieces and mundane components for [[#Enchanter|Enchanting]]. Masters of detail, silversmiths may be brought in to finish the crafting of weaponry with filigree or other such ornamental decoration as well as crafting full pieces.

Craftsman following the silversmithing profession may start by simply polishing and smoothing of pieces completed by a more advanced craftsman before being given projects of their own. As the craftsman progresses through the ranks, they may be given access to more expensive materials and then access to secrets of how the guild crafts the finest and most expensive of pieces.
