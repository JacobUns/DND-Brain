It is believed that [[Onatar]] bore children by the elves, leading to their exceedingly long lives and exquisite craftsmanship. Their association to the goddess led to worship among the elves as Idols in their own right. It is unknown by the world whether these idols still exist in secret, hoarding their power, or whether they too were wiped out during the Ending War.
