Little is known about the origins of The Raven Queen, but within the right circles it is believed that she was a demi-god born of [[Melorkis, The Shadow]].

Her depiction as Elven and association with the Elven religions pre-[[Ending War]] has resulted in the worship of The Raven Queen being banned by The Great Council even though some teachings associated to [[Olladra]] indicate that she was usurped. The Temples to [[Olladra]] setup by The Great Council claim she was not [[#Usurpation|usurped]], but was instead [[#Shattered]] and managed to reform after extensive time. This is a hole in teachings that sits uncomfortably for many scholars, but few are willing to openly criticise the teachings for fear of punishment under the Guardians of Il'Mondum.
