Lost to time, the Arcandor Academy have released rhetoric on the existence of cults that idolise a creature only known as The Dragon Below. It is believed that this Draconic being gained enough of a following during The Ending War to become a minor [[#deity]] in its own right.

Nothing in the history and writings discovered indicates whether this creature is alive or not, and occasionally the Guardians of Il'Mondum are sent to obscure locations with little to no explanation which some rumour is to combat the Dragon Below which still lives. The Arcandor Academy has been known to say that there is no verifiable evidence of this being the case, and these are likely drunken stories at the bar told by those who have had too much to drink and not enough sense.
