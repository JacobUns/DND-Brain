# World Theology
The history of the pantheon is fairly well established and agreed amongst theologians of the council. Priests and Temple officials from across the continent gathered after the [[Ending War]] to identify the doctrine that would be permitted following the fall of Elves and Dragons, ensuring any teachings that may have contributed to this war over millennia would not come to be taught again. As a result, following the [[Ending War]] the council, through their actions, implied two groups of deities; They would come to be known as [[#The Sovereign Host]] and [[#The Dark Six]].

Throwing their full resources behind The Sovereign Host, the council employed architects, builders guilds, craftsmen and their chosen officials to begin tearing down the iconography of those gods and idols of the elves and dragons, replacing them with sanctioned iconography.

The Temple Priests would begin to teach the history of the pantheon in their own ways, and over the next few centuries would develop disparate methods, tenants, stories and environments for worship. All share the same creationism story premise with varying details that have evolved over centuries, which begins with [[#The Genesis]].
## The Genesis
Two powers, in perfect balance. The [[#Prime]] forces of the multiverse; [[Arawai]], the beginning of all things, and [[Erador]], the creeping end existed like a snake eating its own tail. For eons they evenly balanced each other; an infinite game where every move one made the other countered in a perfect stalemate. Each [[#Prime]] driven to continue the directive it had been imbued with, not knowing or caring where these impulses to create and destroy originated. Until something changed, the events of which would come to be known as The Genesis.

[[Arawai]] and [[Erador]] came to an accord. [[Arawai]] would be allowed to create something new with the help of [[Erador]], but the help would come at the cost of the ultimate end of each living entity. With this agreement in place, the two [[#Prime|Primes]] would spend millennia designing all things. Their creations spanned and overlapped in space and time, growing more complex with each creation until the two found themselves stretching their capabilities.

The more the two created, the harder they found it to stay balanced. Some theologians theorise that this is seen in the lifespan of certain races or creatures, where as others believe the cause of this stems from divine blood. Others still believe races with longer lives may have made pacts with the gods, and others angered them.

Whatever the cause, the [[#Prime|Primes]] agreed to separate some of their power into beings with the power and responsibility to govern their creations in certain Domains. The first born of the [[#Prime|Primes]] were [[Aureon]], goddess of Order and Justice, [[Dol Arrah]], goddess of Light, [[Olladra]], goddess of Fate, and [[Balinor]], god of beasts.

The first-generation of [[#Deity|deities]] were created with equal amounts of power from both [[#Prime|primes]]. In this, they were able to operate without the oversight of their parents. [[Olladra]], [[Erador]]'s favourite, would come to ensure that all would end as she weaved the creations of her parents and siblings into a tapestry only visible to her eyes, carefully curating the end of each creation.
## The Second Generation
As their children designed and created, the [[#Prime|Primes]] found themselves turning back in their eternal game. Though they continued to fill their multiverse with new and ever more complex creations, they soon found themselves envious of their children's ability to operate without a balancing force acting against them. Slowly, their behaviour became more extreme ultimately leading the two to conflict.

Eventually, seeing the chaos being generated by the two, [[Aureon]] would come to suggest a second-generation of [[#Deity|deities]] that would stabilize the powers of the two [[#Prime|primes]] to a level that would not undo all the work of the pantheon. Some teachings preach that [[Olladra]], with the wisdom of the fate weave, whispered to [[Aureon]] what would happen if they were allowed to continue their conflict and that it was this that prompted the goddess's actions.

The [[#Prime|Primes]] would come to see the truth of their child's words, and a second-generation would be created with the assistance and guidance of the first. [[Aureon]] guided the creation of [[Onatar]], goddess of craftsmen, [[Dol Arrah]] guided the creation of [[Kol Korran]], goddess of trade, and [[Balinor]] guides the creation of [[Boldrei]].

During this of divine investiture, [[Dol Arrah]] noted that a mortal seemed to have become able to wield some of power of the divine. Unsure how it had been done, but impressed and captivated by the skills exhibited by the mortal, she sought out [[Aureon]] seeking to understand if it was possible to elevate the mortal to a divine state. [[Aureon]] would protest that it would go against the natural order, [[#Dol Arrah & Aureon|leading to conflict between the two]] that would end with the goddesses becoming rivals in all things.

[[Olladra]], witnessing their conflict, would come to interfere and influence [[Dol Arrah]] to seek out [[Erador]]. [[Olladra]]'s sway over the [[#Prime]] would lead to the first [[#Ascension]], unbeknownst to her siblings or to [[Arawai]]. Through a combination of sculpting fate's tapestry and carefully manipulating [[Erador]], she would come to trick the [[#Prime]] into infusing the divine power the mortal was manipulating into his very being. The [[#Prime]] realised too late what had come to pass; in its fury, [[Erador]] threw its power against [[Olladra]] barely restraining itself from [[#shattered|shattering]] the goddess due to the cries of abject pain of its favoured offspring. The mortal, whose original name was lost to time, would come to be known as [[Dol Dorn]], god of the arcane.
## The Corruption
After centuries of peace between within the pantheon, the material plane had seen a golden age of development; but all good comes to an end. The [[#Prime|primes]] had not created any new offspring since the second generation. [[Arawai]] had attempted to convince [[Erador]] to do so on numerous occasions, but [[Erador]] maintained that their power was dispersed enough and that doing so would start to make them vulnerable to their offspring should they ally against the [[#Prime|primes]].

Against his will, [[Arawai]] attempted to create more offspring and produced four new gods; [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]], [[Malis, The Mockery|Malis]], [[Ithos, The Devourer|Ithos]] and [[Hython, The Keeper|Hython]]. With the relatively recent, in the lifespan on an immortal force, betrayal of [[Olladra]] in creating [[Dol Dorn]], when [[Erador]] came to find the [[#prime]] attempting to unscrupulously syphon its power it was furious. Instead of bringing its force to bear upon the newly spawned [[#Deity|deities]], [[Erador]] allowed its power to be syphoned but warped the nature of [[Arawai]]'s creations. The pure creations that were meant to provide outlets for hope, serenity, peace and reverence would instead become twisted and tainted with evil intent, ultimately leading to the selfish and warped goals of the four gods.

Where direct conflict between the divine beings of the first and second generations had been rare, the newly [[#Emergent|emerged]] [[#Deity|deities]] would change this. [[Erador]]'s divine desire for endings would seep deeply into the souls of the four, and with ruthless and cold determination they would set out to harry the domains and creations of their older siblings. [[Ithos, The Devourer|Ithos]] would trigger disease and disaster over throughout the world his siblings had so carefully crafted, leaving [[Hython, The Keeper|Hython]] to capitalise on the damage, stirring the greed and debauchery of neighbouring regions into a frenzy. While [[Ithos, The Devourer|Ithos]] and [[Hython, The Keeper|Hython]] would focus on the material plane, [[Malis, The Mockery|Malis]] and [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] would target the divine politics of the pantheon sowing doubt and fanning the flames emotions within the Astral Plane, disrupting [[#The Sovereign Host]]'s ability to care for their devastated creations.

As with their parents, the [[#Prime|primes]], [[#The Sovereign Host]] would need to turn their focus to their dark willed siblings to counter their movements and actions. This would see the divine beings withdrawing more and more from their creations in order to preserve their existence. Still, a cycle of destruction and creation would continue in balance.
## The Ascension
The manner of [[Dol Dorn]]'s existence would remain secret knowledge of the gods involved in the creation of the [[#Deity]] for eons. It would be [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] who, with his stealth and ability to seek out that which he should not know, would the knowledge come surface.

[[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]], in an effort to manipulate [[#The Sovereign Host]], would invest his focus into darker powers including the creation of Hemalergy, the study of blood magic. Through experimentation on mortal beings through torture and psionic probing, [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] would start to sense a familiarity between the mortals and the god [[Dol Dorn]]. Peaking his interest, and sensing a method of manipulating the [[Dol Dorn]], [[Melorkis, The Shadow|the god of secrets]] would begin shadowing and investigating all of his siblings to uncover the truth.

Eventually, [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] would come to observe [[Dol Arrah]] and [[Olladra]] conferring. Sensing a plot or move being made by [[#The Sovereign Host]], he would slip into the goddesses' domains seeking what they were hiding. What he found would shake the pantheon to its core, bring the divine assembly to its knees, and shape their interactions with the mortal planes forever.

The goddesses would be hiding schemes to elevate another mortal to divine standing. [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]]'s suspicions on the connection and sense of familiarity between [[Dol Dorn]] clicked into place. Though he didn't know how this could be possible, he came to learn of the mortal they intended to [[#Ascendant|ascend]].

As with [[Dol Dorn]], his original name would be lost to time, but he would come to be known as [[Samic]]. A tiefling, sired of one of the creatures of [[Ithos, The Devourer|Ithos]] that now resided in the nine hells, who seemed to have the uncanny ability to divert the light of [[Dol Arrah]] and capture the void that remained. The goddess had become enamoured with the skill and ability to manipulate the divine energy the mortal possessed. He reminded her of [[Dol Dorn]] during the creation of [[#The Second Generation]], and sought out [[Olladra]] to help convince [[Erador]] to repeat his previous act. [[Dol Arrah]] had not known of the clandestine nature of [[Olladra]]'s actions, and, when she had come to learn of the manner of [[Dol Dorn]]'s [[#Ascendant|ascension]], had chastised the goddess insisting this time would be done with honesty.

The two goddesses would gain audience with [[Erador]], and [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] would follow. Respecting the Tiefling's ability to access [[Erador]]'s domain of void and the approach taken by [[Dol Arrah]], [[Erador]] put aside his disappointment and anger with [[Olladra]] and agreed to once more elevate a mortal. [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] would observe the ritual, and once complete would go about learning how this feat had become possible. After extensive time, he would find his answers.

Armed with a terrible power, he would convene with his dark willed siblings to share the knowledge with the intent to overthrow and destroy [[Erador]]. Each of the siblings would come to elevate one mortal. [[Ithos, The Devourer|Ithos]], who claimed himself the eldest, proclaimed his divine right to use this power first. He chose a mortal woman, the brutal leader of a tribe of roaming savages. He imbued her with his ruthless bloodlust, intent on creating the ultimate divine warrior to purge the pantheon; she would be remembered by the name [[Kami, The Fury|Kami]].

[[Malis, The Mockery|Malis]] chose a fiery haired archfey, intent on sowing chaos in [[#The Sovereign Host]] as a form of distraction from their ultimate goal. The archfey, [[Artagan, The Traveller|Artagan]], held court in his lair but would regularly meddle in the affairs of the [[Feywild]], garnering enough power and influence to become a recognised and feared name within the domain.

When asked who [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] would elevate, he claimed his right to chose at a time that saw fit to him and, not wanting to be outdone, [[Hython, The Keeper|Hython]] proclaimed the same. Both [[Ithos, The Devourer|Ithos]] and [[Malis, The Mockery|Malis]] took umbrage with this, but, with a stand off between the four, were forced to accept the decision. The two would eventually elevate two mortal creatures to the seats of the divine, but it would come in the midst of [[#The Shattering]].

It is not agreed why [[Hython, The Keeper|Hython]] elevated [[Vol, the Deathless Martyr]] of the draconic races, to divine levels. Some theologians hypothesise that he did it due to the draconic tendency towards hoarding treasures, greed and revelry of their followers. Others believe that it was [[Hython, The Keeper|Hython]] himself that instilled this desire in the race of creatures, and that through his influence [[Vol, the Deathless Martyr|Vol]] rose to prominence and power. Theologians that hold this belief claim that, as reward and manipulation for his service, [[Hython, The Keeper|Hython]] elevated [[Vol, the Deathless Martyr|Vol]] to the divine.

[[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]], ever scheming, would eventually elevate an elf whose name has been lost to history and time. One of the evolving rhetoric items has come to claim that the decision was romantic, and that [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] had sired a child by the elf. [[#The Dark Six]] would question the decision and value the elf would bring to their coming efforts, but [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis's]] plan would soon come to light. [[The Raven Queen]] would be [[#Ascendant|ascended]] to the divine. Little is known of her, and even less publicly consumed since the fall of the elves, but what is known by theologians indicates a dark and mysterious figure that would play a key part in events to come.
## The Shattering
All divine power flows from its unknown origin resulting in the [[#Prime]] deities. From their power all other [[#Deity|Deities]] and [[#Idol|Idols]] are created, but in each previous instance to the events of [[#The Ascension]], at least one of the [[#Prime]] forces were involved. With the first elevation of [[Kami, The Fury|Kami]], [[Erador]] noted a small but not insignificant reduction in the power they wielded and grew suspicious. [[Erador]] grew ever more paranoid as [[Artagan, The Traveller|Artagan]] and [[Vol, the Deathless Martyr|Vol]] were elevated and more parts of their power seemed to ebb away, and for the first time since [[#Emergent|emerging]] as a [[#Prime]], [[Erador]] knew the touch of fear.

A terrible dawning washed over [[Erador]] as the [[#Prime]] looked upon its creations and saw destruction and ruin being left in the wake of a divine force not of its creating. [[#Shape Changing|Masking its appearance]], the [[#Prime]] ventured down to the material plane to investigate the wake of ruin with feelings of awe, fury and the now familiar sense of fear. With [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis's]] help, [[Kami, The Fury|Kami]] would evade [[Erador]] each time the [[#Prime]] attempted to end her reign of terror. The [[#Prime|Prime's]] anger would scar the surface of [[R'Ellanthas]], and through [[Kami, The Fury|Kami]] would come to be known as [[Kami, The Fury]] of [[Erador]], this would later be simplified to [[Kami, The Fury]].

[[Erador|Erador's]] dismay would only increase as a red-haired deity would begin to assist in [[Kami, The Fury|Kami's]] escapes. Again, the [[#Prime]] would feel the divine power emanate from the creature, but it was not of the [[#Prime|Prime's]] doing. [[Erador|Erador's]] suspicions would turn to [[Arawai]]. Their history with the events of [[#The Corruption]] caused the [[#Prime]] to believe [[Arawai]] too had started elevating creatures. It's belief that [[Arawai]], who had shown a desire to create in isolation already, would lead to conflict between the two [[#Prime|Primes]] once again.

[[Erador]] would confront [[Arawai]] in the [[Astral Plane]]. Their conflict over the events of [[#The Ascension]] would bring to light [[Erador|Erador's]] hypocrisy, and [[Arawai|Arawai's]] anger would burn brightly enough to cause waves of divine energy in the [[Astral Plane|Astral Sea]]. Her anger with the [[#Prime]], the conflict between the beings, and the burning hatred towards the one that corrupted what had been created would be the fires to forge the alliance between [[Arawai]] and [[#The Dark Six]].

[[Malis, The Mockery|Malis]], showing distain for their treatment, would lead the shattering of [[Erador]], bringing his wrath to bare against the being that corrupted he and his siblings. Learning of the power given to [[Dol Dorn]] and then [[Samic]], he saw the act as a slight against them. Their combined power, with that of their [[#Ascendant]] prodigies, would tip the balance in [[Arawai|Arawai's]] favour.

Fearing what the celestial landscape would become should [[#The Dark Six]] come to take hold of the [[Astral Plane]], those of [[#The Genesis]] and [[#The Second Generation]] would come to war in aid of [[Erador]]. And so, the battlelines would be drawn and war would rage in the [[Upper Planes]] for centuries to the present day. In this time, it is preached by some temples, beliefs and orders and by the rhetoric of the council that both [[Erador]] and [[Arawai]] would be [[#Shattered]] and their power dispersed and locked into powerful relics hidden away in the [[Planes of Existence]] by members of the pantheon. The faiths associated to the [[#Prime|Primes]] believe this to be false, agreeing that they were in part [[#Shattered]], but that [[#Prime]] power unlike [[#Emergent]] power could not be wholly confined and that the [[#Prime|Primes]] therefore continue to work within the [[Planes of Existence|planes]].

During the conflict, the secret elven child of [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] would come to seize the opportunity to take the place of [[Olladra]]. The temples associated with [[Olladra]] teach that this was part of the tapestry, but other theologians and teachings preach that [[Malis, The Mockery|Malis]] tainted the child seeing the potential for [[#The Dark Six]] to gain more of a foothold in the pantheon. It is also argued by some that although [[The Raven Queen]] may have been bestowed power by [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]], it was not that of [[#Ascension]], believing instead that [[Melorkis, The Shadow|Melorkis]] is yet to [[#Ascension|ascend]] his chosen prodigy. This would mean that [[The Raven Queen]] may be the first example recorded in theology of [[#Usurpation]].

Some temples preach that the war between the pantheon rages on eternally and that the followers of the faiths ascend to the [[Astral Plane]] themselves when they pass from the [[Material Plane]], going to assist their [[#Deity]] in the fight against [[#The Dark Six]]. Different temples that follow the same [[#Deity|deities]] also preach that their divine being of choice is pure and has put down their weapons against the [[#Prime|Primes]] and their siblings. It is unknown which, if any, are true, and lower ranking members of the [[Guardians of Il'Mondum]] are regularly found reinforcing the rhetoric of [[The Great Coucil]] where it deviates the agreed scripture to keep the peace in the empire, though some tolerance is permitted to allow for individuality of the temples.

#### Depictions
History is written by the survivors, and so is true of the depictions of the deities created by the artisans of the council. The council being made up predominantly of humans resulted in the recognised depictions of the deities mostly as human; there are a few exceptions to this including [[Balinor]], [[Onatar]], and [[Samic]].  

There has been some public unrest due to the perceived discrimination outside of the human race despite the attempted placations of the council. There have been a few minor riots where economic circumstances have been severe that appear to have been sparked by protests on the topic, but generally the unrest has surfaced via scholarly debate and peaceful protest. One notable exception to this saw the burning and pillaging of several temples before city watch neutralised those responsible through force. The subsequent public executions and retribution did nothing to calm public image, and those responsible in the council were quickly sacrificed to stop a coup and rebellion beginning.

The depictions vary based on region, race and way of life. Scholars of the Arcandor Academy have noted a trend towards depictions of certain members of the pantheon, including the [[#Prime|primes]], remaining human no matter where in the continent you go. There are theories as to why this may be, including social pressures of the council itself, but surveying of the populous provided little clarity. Other members of the pantheon vary regularly in size, shape, race and even gender. This is understood and accepted by the council as simply artistic expression, but their own depictions remain vastly the same.
## The Dark Six
The Dark Six are well recognised, but often aligned with evil and therefore are socially frowned upon. It is rare for these gods to be worshipped openly in many major cities, but shrines and small temples can still be found in more rural areas. This is especially true of The Fury and The Traveller, as many argue these are not inherently evil paths. Still, these deities are often revered behind closed doors, or by cults, rather than the general population.

## Dwarven
As one of the factions that did not involve themselves in the formation of the council, the dwarves claim to have their own pantheon. World Theologians believe these to be the same pantheon of gods, simply known by different names. This is disputed by the Dwarves due to the nature of their worship being different to those gods of the council.

To anyone outside of the dwarven culture, the pantheon represented and worshipped by the dwarves is a topic of some disdain; the dwarves do not draw a line between The Dark Six and The Sovereign Host, worshipping each in their own right, which causes much unrest in the council and its theologically advisors.

### Dead Faiths
#### Draconic
##### Gods
It is theorised that Gods or Idols were created through the use of [[Arawai]]'s power, but as worship of the Draconic faiths has fallen to disrepute so too has the common knowledge of who or what these [[#Deity|deities]] may have been. Scraps of history shared by the Arcandor Academy seem to indicate at least one name of a Draconic [[#Deity]]; [[Vol, the Deathless Martyr]]. It is secretly theorised that [[Erador]] may have had a hand in the creation of a new god with [[Arawai]] and that they therefore may continue to exist.
##### Faiths
With the destruction of the Draconic race during The [[Ending War]], the faiths associated were banned from being practised by the races that remained. Any worship of these faiths is subject to discipline by the [[Guardians of Il'Mondum]].

## Champions
The deities of the world have rarely been seen in the material plane since [[#The Shattering]]. Most believe these to be myths and fairy tales told to children by the orders of clerics and schools of bards. There rumours in the right theological circles that each of the gods has their own champion, imbued with minor amounts of the [[#Deity|Deity's]] power to enact their will on the material plane. These agents are argued to enable the gods to act against each other without making themselves vulnerable.
![[Champion of a deity.png]]
## Oracles
The pantheon, early in their dealings with mortals, designated an oracle who would act as the mystical voice for the gods. Each deity would become so consumed with their own creations in time that they would individually communicate with those they deign to be worthy of them, and would soon come to reinvest their time in each of their designs. The position of Oracle would remain in it's original role, however, continuing to connect into the fate weave knitted by [[Olladra]] to be able to communicate with each of the gods.

As with all creatures that pass, the traditions of the oracle would need to be passed down from Oracle to Oracle. The rituals and ceremonies around this transition would be shrouded in secrecy, with only those that have passed through the veil knowing how the powers are passed on. Some claim it requires the death of the previous Oracle, their power flowing directly from the predecessor to the successor, where as others claim it is possible for anyone to learn.

With [[Olladra]]'s fall, some would come to claim that the Oracle position must be corrupt and [[The Raven Queen]] must be influencing and corrupting the vision into the fate weave. Others continue to revere the position as something of pure divinity. As with most faith in rural areas, the traditions and practices of the populous often influence the opinions of the next generation, with some going so far as extremism while others practice moderation.
# Becoming an Idol or Deity
## Ascension
### Bestowal of Power
### Usurpation
## Belief and Worship
Though not true [[#Deity|deities]], belief and worship can elevate a mortal to the status of an [[#Idol]].
These [[#Idol|idols]] have almost [[#Ascendant]] properties, seemingly syphoning some level of divine power from the [[#Prime|primes]]. It takes a monumental following to achieve this status, typically cultivated over centuries rather than decades. As such, the majority of known [[#Idol|idols]], though not discussed openly, are either of Elvish or Draconic origin including the members of the [[The Blood of Vol]] and [[The Undying Court]].
# Keywords
### Ascendant
Mortal creatures can become [[#Deity|Deities]] by [[#bestowal of power]] by one of the existing pantheon or by [[#Usurpation|usurping]] and taking a god's power. Ascendency by either method delegates the mortal all or a portion of the originating [[#Prime|prime's]] own raw power in the same way as [[#Emergent]] [[#Deity|Deities]]. Ascendency is, therefore, mythical in nature when discussed by mortals. Due to the nature of ascendancy, the mortal becomes immortal and part of the energy that makes up the planes.
### Corrupted
Given enough time and the correct knowledge, the gods have been known to be able to affect each other in various ways. Theologians posit that this requires them to imbue the deity with some of their energy to do so, making the imbued deity more powerful and themselves less powerful. Teachings from the temple talk of the events of [[#The Corruption]] as the only major event of a [[#Prime]] affecting multiple deities at once. Other teachings talk of corruption being used for revenge or divine politics.
### Deity
An immortal manifestation of power. It is created with certain responsibilities and domains as decided by the creator. Usually, this is done when a deity loses interest in the domain, and create a deity who embodies the very nature of that domain to serve as its keeper and protector.
### Emergent
Emergent gods are "born" of the power bestowed upon them by their "parent". In sacrificing some of their power, they leave themselves weaker and vulnerable to their counterparts. As a result, deities are typically created in cohorts to ensure equilibrium.

[[#Deity|Deities]] other than [[#Prime|Primes]] cannot themselves bestow power to another creature, and require the assistance of a prime to do so. The primes are therefore reticent to do so independently to ensure they maintain a close balance in their strengths

They, like the power itself, are genderless, but each can identify as it sees fit and rarely, if ever, change following this decision.
### Idol
A non-divine creature that has a level of associated faith that has elevated them to the divine. These creatures may have cultivated their own following, elevating them to a level of divine power, or may be demi-gods in their own right. It is unknown whether Idols are immortal, mortal, or both.

In circles of backroom theology, members of the Arcandor Academy claim to have seen information in association with this leading to rumours, but it appears these individuals have been met by the Guardians of Il'Mondum and have not been seen again. Idols are not widely known about by the population of the modern age due to their affiliation with forbidden faiths.
### Prime
Theology indicates that there were two powers that shaped and formed the planes and the pantheon, though there is obviously no way for this to be verified. These Primes are believed to work in balance and originally held far more power than the Ascendant and Emergent deities. 
### Shattered
[[#Deity|Deities]] are manifestations of power and energy; though they can take human form when not in the Astral Plane, as with all natural energy it cannot be created or destroyed, purely transformed. As such, though a [[#Deity]] cannot be killed, it can be shattered; transformed into many disparate parts. This shattering is caused when two divine powers collide. One of stronger power will overcome the weaker, causing it to fracture and eventually shatter. Two equal powers colliding results in both ultimately shattering in a stalemate.

As with anything broken, it can be repaired; the shards of a shattered god can be brought together to reform it, restoring the deity to its previous strength. This can happen naturally over eons or through the labour of bringing these shattered powers together.

Myth among mortals indicates the power of a shattered deity can be wielded by mortals, but it is unknown how. If this is the case, theologians theorise that the likeliest way this could occur is by a divine power locking a shard into an item, and that a deity would not be able to reform until all parts are released from these items. If these powers can be wielded, it is a closely guarded secret by the temples and orders of clerics.
