# About
Once a promising young artist that really became famous for the Starry Night painting. It came out of the blue and, though he had painted landscapes before, it was the first and only nightscape created by the artist. Sadly, it would be his last painting as the artist died young and in a mysterious way, turning up dead and alone in his house. [[Windfall]] was his home city, and rumours there suggested that he fell in with the wrong crowd and that this may have been the cause of his death. He died a couple of hundred years ago.
