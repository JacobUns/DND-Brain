The group have some downtime and attend to some personal ventures.

[[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]]
- Performs some odd jobs for the information network.

[[Tiscordin]]
- Investigates reference to the tower of everlasting light
	- Research shows the tower of everlasting light is the same as that of the Tower of Light in the [[Enlightened Empire]]
	- As an architect by trade, he believes the tower is of Elvish origins and design
	- The tower can be accessed by the public, but certain areas are closed off.
- Investigates the Lightbringer of the [[Enlightened Empire]]
	- Is believed by his people to be a "Living God"
	- Delivered his people from the Elves
	- The empire is mostly human but welcomes other races, but its a cold welcome
	- Scriptures have been brought back by [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] to review
	- [[Aolani|Ao]] receives information on Elvish Deities
- Speaks with [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] on what has been found
	- [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] doesn't believe the rhetoric and propaganda of the dragons any more than he does the elves.
	- Hasn't spent long on the topic of dragons
	- Says "Some dragons are not of a good nature"

[[Aolani|Ao]]
- Finds speculative information on Aasimar
- Lower on the celestials hierarchy, similar to Tieflings to Demons
- Part human, part celestial, but can also be of Fey ancestory
- May be manifested champions of the gods

[[Brezek]]
- Investigates a depiction of weaponary used by the Elves
	- Investigates a mechanical construct on a large scale that seems to have some kind of weaponary. Seems to be energy based weaponry
	- Started to construct titanous weaponry to combat the dragons
	- [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] shows off a broken sleek rifle-like energy weapon of elvish make. May be more in other site locations
	- Works on it at [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]]'s workshop & understands the nature of it, but requires more time with the item to get it in a working order

[[Aolani|Ao]] is approached by [[Howie]], a member of the thieves guild. He tells [[Aolani|Ao]] that an auction holds a painting of a beautiful starry night. It'll be held in the auction house for two weeks, and will take two further weeks to arrive. The thieves guild want [[Aolani|Ao]] to steal the painting and bring it to them.

The group start on the road to [[Vilasenrin]] and arrive after four days of travel. [[Tiscordin]] sends out raven familiars and finds an entry to the ruins down a ravine. Lumin scouts ahead of the group and makes it to the tunnel to find footprints leading inside. They seem to be human but its difficult to tell.

The tunnel is natural rock & partway along are wooden supporting beams. He continues on, triggering a rock trap to fall and block the path back. He chooses to continue on, coming across an open cavern with a river running through it. There, he finds an ornate and ancient bridge across a chasm. There are runes scratched into a wall nearby, and as he progresses he hears a conversation. Complex & intertwined walkways & bridges span the chasm with staircases leading off in different directions. Two figures stand atop one of the bridges in conversation, one wearing tight black clothing and the other wearing looser dark clothing.

[[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] turns back, digging through the rock just as the group start to wonder what's taking him so long. Finding no sign of [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] as the group enter, they find three sets of human sized footprints and one set of large humanoid prints. We estimate that the creature is probably about nine feet tall, and, based on the shape, [[Aolani|Ao]] believes they may be Giant.

After reuniting with [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] and traveling back inside, the group find the two men still in deep discussion. Both groups call out to each other and claim to be [[Guardians of Il'Mondum]]. In the chaos that ensues from both sides claiming to be people they aren't, [[Brezek]] instructs an invisible TBD to fly up next to one of the men and shocking grasp him. Battle ensues and shortly after the two men are joined by a giant. The men are downed but the giant scoops up one he refers to as "the boss" and retreats deeper. 

During combat, another man emerges and runs from something he refers to as a "guardian". A large mechanical ball appears and engages the group. It is significantly stronger than it appears and does massive damage to the group. [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] is downed multiple times while everyone else sustains severe injuries. Eventually, the group fells the construct and [[Brezek]] harvests a large Arc Cell & materials to improve his Mechanipig construct. [[Aolani|Ao]] finds 80gp, an Elvish Sword & Studded Leather armour.

The group use familiar to explore 8 passageways that lead out of the cavern. From most, the group learns there are dwellings here that once housed elvish people. One path appears to lead to a richer district with a large building standing prominently which looks like a temple. Another pathway leads down a waterfall has a massive Fey-like forest with a ceiling covered in algae that glows blue.

TBD returns and plays charades with [[Brezek]] and the group. He communicates there are buildings with objects inside that the group may be interested in. The group agrees to search a few passages, starting with the imposing buildings which have a large sliding metal gate out front. Four buildings standing a courtyard, and the group find what appears to be a gatehouse inside. We open the front gate & another inside which leads to what appears to be a charging station for the Guardian Constructs. In the other room there are terminals with chairs in front of each and a large console stands in the middle of the room. It appears to have multiple charging points for Arc Cells.

[[Tiscordin]] brings Elzana out, and she explains that the consoles on the walls can allow her to access the network of this place. She informs [[Tiscordin]] & [[Aolani|Ao]] that this is a construct research & development centre. The earliest entry is one from the beginning of [[the Ending War]]. Elzana downloads an up-to-date history for the end of the Elves and Dragons. The group also asks for information on the charging stations, and she informs us that if the guardians are not fully charged then they will not deploy. We instruct her to turn the points off.

Searching for information, we find that the four buildings are:
- Research & Development
	- Searched, finding 3 guardians and the Arc Cell charging stations
- Barracks
	- Searched, finding energy based elvish weaponry
- Restricted Access
	- Titanous Construct
- Admin Building
	- Key card creation & terminal for Elzana

The Barracks have sleeping quarters & stairs with a locked metal door that requires a keycard. Elzana creates a keycard for them group, and behind the door the group find finely crafted swords & rapiers, longbows, shortbows, shields, two rifles and a pistol-like weapon. Arc Cells in 2x5 stacks are also present as ammunition for the rifles.

The group long rests and then goes to the restricted access building. Inside there are three rooms; a conference room, an empty room with buttons on the wall and space for a keycard, and a room full of chairs and desks. Elzana tells the group the building is an advanced and experimental weapons facility, some were quite well-known Elvish scientists. A testing lab is available via an elevator and Elzana informs the group how to operate it.

Taking the elevator down, the group finds an enormous room with command panels, screens, chains, machinery, and objects that we believe may have once produced power. As the group moves, motion detectors trigger and turn overhead lights on. The room seems entirely clean with nothing to leave dust.

[[Brezek]] casts detect magic & finds some information on the items being carried by the party.
- [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] - Sword, Mask, Item in a Bag. The mask is Evocation magic and the Item is Necromancy & Transfiguration
- [[Tiscordin]] - Bag, Ring, Necklace and Face. Appear to emanate Abjuration and Illusion.

Further into the room, the group find a titanous construct similar to the one seen in [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]]'s painting. There appears to be some way back to the surface up a long shaft above the construct.
