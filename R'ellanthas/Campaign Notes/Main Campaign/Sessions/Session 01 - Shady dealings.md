# Session
Moving quietly through the streets of [[Nuvrin]], [[Aolani]] approaches an alley. The location has been given to him by cloaked figure who claim they "can't say who they work for" - only that they work for "The Merchant". The alley is to be a meeting point for an important message, and there were people attending this location that he should meet.

A stealthy figure stands quietly to the side, while [[Aolani]] hides himself and observes. Three thug-like figures approach before suddenly a flash of light outside of the alley causes confusion. Four cloaked figures in blue attempt to take a figure that appears to be in ranger garb and disappear through a portal.

Before long, a fight breaks out in the alley. The stealthy figure, who comes to be introduced as [[Tiscordin]], emits a magical fear while [[Aolani]] emits waves of both light and shadow in bursts. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] emerges from a portal in the air, and a little dwarven figure piloted by [[Brezek]] flies into the alley. The sudden burst of motion and light from lots of directions causes the thugs to flee the scene.

After brief introductions that reveal everyone seems to have been provided information to meet here by similar messaging with the claim they "can't say who they work for", the group move to a tavern. [[Tiscordin]] introduces [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]], a masked figure who eats separately from the group in his rooms before rejoining in the main drinking area. They have travelled with [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] before, and [[Aolani]] says they have also before going their separate ways. They are on a path to [[Rupgen]] hunting a spy for [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin]] of [[Nuvrin]]. They also inform that, once they've completed their investigation, they intend to explore an elven ruin nearby in search of artefacts. The group aligns and agrees to travel together and then head to sleep.

In the morning, the group head to [[Boldbottom's Boutique|Boldbottom's]] to buy some potions and then move on to [[Nuvrin#Zin's Books and Knowledge|Zin's Books and Knowledge]]. The bookstore appears to be a normal bookstore, and to all intents and purposes it serves customers as one, but secretly acts as an information brokerage for those in the know. Before leaving, [[Aolani]] asks if they have any information that might help him understands his lineage, claiming he's been called something called an Aasimar. They give him a book called "Lines & Lineages of Celestial Beings: A written theory".

The group head out of the city towards [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin]]'s estate. On the way, those new to [[Nuvrin]] note it appears to be a well kept city, with no slums to be seen anywhere. After a short period of travel, the group realise there are four people who have seemingly followed them out of the city gates. The group stops at the side of the road and confronts their pursuers. They claim they want the letter back that the thugs had been carrying, which has apparently already been burnt by [[Tiscordin]]. After being intimidated by the group, they run.

At the [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Duchess's]] mansion, [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] asks for aid for his people in the form of military backing. She agrees so long as [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] can prove his usefulness to the kingdom. She believes there is a plot to overthrow the [[Kalvenen]] monarchy. She claims there are definitely four of the Dukedoms that are involved in the coup.

[[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]] has knowledge of Artifact locations through a [[Professor Sikud]], a unique older lived individual that doesn't see time the same way as others. She declines to elaborate on what that means, only to say it will be obvious. She also identifies a symbol on a wax seal as part of the coup plot.

The group makes for their next location of [[Rupgen]]. Along the way, they find what appears to be a dead drop location hidden just off the path. The location holds a letter for someone named [[Ral Moonshine]] located in [[Rimemir]] along with an ornate box, within which are three small Arc Cells. The group decides that the location could be a good spot to stay for the night, as it is a well camouflaged hole with enough space for all of them to bed down.

It is here that [[Tiscordin]] & [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] reveal the existence of [[Elzana]], an Elvish construct blessed with sentience that acts as a lore keeper for Elven knowledge and has informed the group she is not the only one in existence. They claim to have found it in [[Milanalin]] and that she had previously been owned by a High Marshal Kellen Lithrexor. Through this they learn the elven location they're heading to outside of [[Rupgen]] is a collapsed elven city called [[Vilasenrin]].

The group's night is abruptly ended early hours of the morning when a group attempts to enter the hole. A fight breaks out after crossbow bolts are fired by the men at the group. Eventually, the attackers are felled and using speak with dead the group get some information from the men. They claim to be working for [[Gemmen Zrayax]], the leader of a [[Nuvrin]] cell of smugglers and thugs and that they are associated with the same men that followed the group out of the city.

Entering the town of [[Rupgen]], the group find a fairly quiet fishing town. Asking around, they find that the closest tavern is called the [[Rupgen#Jolly Clam Inn|Jolly Clam Inn]]. There is also a bookstore, called [[Rupgen#Pebble Belch Books|Pebble Belch Books]], that [[Tiscordin]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] believe are related to the information network. The group also get information here on key locations, including the Alderman's lodgings, which are at the top of the hill, and [[Professor Sikud|Professor Sikud's]].

In the [[Rupgen#Jolly Clam Inn|Jolly Clam Inn]], the group learn of a suspicious figure that's been lurking around. He's been in the tower for four months and lives up the hill next to the Alderman's. He comes and goes but always keeps to himself, and usually leaves within a couple weeks of arriving.

While sitting in the tavern, the group notice a tortle enter with a cane. The barkeeper informs them that this is [[Professor Sikud]] and the group go to introduce themselves. The professor claims he is a Historian that has lived for more than three hundred years and seen seven kings sit upon the throne, and had met three of them. He agrees to help provide information if we meet him at his tomorrow at mid-day.
