Reunited, the group make their way onto their next location. The group arrives at [[Kalvenen]], a metropolis of 100k people and the capital of the [[Kingdom of Kalvenen]]. The group approaches from the north, and even from the edges of the city can see the central citadel built of white stone atop an artificial hill. As we enter, we are surrounded by slender buildings three or four stories tall and start to make our way down the busy main thoroughfare. There are no guards on the road in, but as the group make it closer to the inner city we find a walled perimeter.

The group looks for the information brokerage, and learns of a bookstore called [[Kalvenen#Xuan's Books|Xuan's]] Books within the walls of the city. Not wanting to be caught with suspicious items from the Elvish ruins, the group give anything they don't want to be found with to [[Tiscordin]], who merges with his raven and flies into the city to await the group at [[Kalvenen#Xuan's Books|Xuan's]].

As the rest of the group moves through the city streets, it's clear that the city is active and bustling with people. As we walk we see a few interesting buildings. Firstly, we come across a [[Boldbottom's Boutique]], familiar to all from their encounter in [[Nuvrin]]. Second, the group sees the auction house signposted [[Kalvenen#Herquens Action House|Herquens Auction House]]. This, to [[Aolani|Ao]], is presumably the auction house holding the Starry Night painting that the thieves guild want. Finally, the group find [[Kalvenen#Xuan's Books|Xuan's Books]], a four-story double wide building it stands as an impressive sight for a bookstore. As the group enters, we see floor to ceiling bookcases ten-feet tall.

We approach the attendant at the front and provide the name of [[Nuvrin#Pebble Belch Books|Pebble Belch Books]], and the attendant shows us into the back of the store. [[Tiscordin]] chooses to search through the shop while the book store attendant continues to serve customers.

[[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] and [[Aolani|Ao]] decide to search the backroom while they have been left on their own. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] finds a secret door, and, with [[Aolani|Ao]] watching for any sign of someone approaching, makes his way down the stairs hidden behind. He finds information on that indicates the representatives of the Dukedoms are to be in the city in the coming days. There are rumours of war with the [[Enlightened Empire]] on the horizon, and this timely gathering appears to be a war meeting. There is also a report of blue clad warriors appearing around [[Bellowfern]]. They appear to have stolen an item in [[Crowhost]] and were sighted in [[Silverfall]] & [[Westfield]]. Satisfied with his findings, [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] returns to the group.

Eventually, both [[Tiscordin]] and the attendant join us in the back. The attendant, a tanned skin human, introduces himself as [[Kimvac Xuan]], the owner of the bookshop. [[Tiscordin]] asks about an entryway to elven ruins and [[Kimvac Xuan|Kimvac]] explains we need a magical key to access the entrance. He doesn't know how the original owner of the store came to take possession of the key but that it's always been in the store since he's owned it. To access the ruins you must venture down to the sewers.

The group also asks about the painting held at the [[Kalvenen#Herquens Action House|auction house]]. [[Kimvac Xuan|Kimvac]] explains it was painted by an artist called [[Eshin Himed]] and that it is currently owned by a rich merchant called [[Harra Narozana]], a human woman. We look to find out if there is anyone that could tell us more about the painting and its contents. He says there is a university in the city with a professor that has expertise in cosmology. We ask [[Kimvac Xuan|Kimvac]] whether he can be bought, which he says he will investigate.

We ask if he has any knowledge of the [[Kalvenen#Herquens Action House|auction house]], how it is guarded and if there are patrols. He explains that the [[Kalvenen#Herquens Action House|auction house]] is a location that is often frequented by the elite of the [[Kingdom of Kalvenen|kingdom]]. He doesn't have any information about patrols or guards, but with enough time is something he could provide.

[[Kimvac Xuan|Kimvac]] also says there are a great deal of the [[Kingdom of Kalvenen|kingdom's]] elite are in the city for a ball which is to come at the end of a war council being held by the nobility. The [[Enlightened Empire]] have been seen to push further into [[Oda]]'s lands and [[King Caladeth Kalvenen|the king]] is being pressured for a response.

***Notes missing*** - [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]] somehow communicates to us that she will meet us at the [[Kalvenen#Herquens Action House|auction house]] at midday tomorrow.

As we leave the bookstore and head towards an Inn, [[Tiscordin]] and [[Aolani|Ao]] notice someone is following them. A dark skin man with a low cut mohawk & moustache trails us wearing dark cloths and trying to be blend in. He's not openly carrying any weapons, but is obviously paying close attention to us. We turn a corner into an alley, and the man walks directly into us as we wait for him. We pull him into the alley and question him. His name is [[Dohko Nog]] and he claims to be from an organisation called [[Orphus]] who are looking to ensure the best interests of the kingdom. The man noticed our late exit from the bookshop and followed. He provides us information about a building in the Glass Forge district of the city. We let the man go with a warning that if we see him again he won't be so lucky the second time. The group finishes their night by heading back to an inn to sleep for the night and plan.

Midday approaches on the following day, and the group heads to the [[Kalvenen#Herquens Action House|auction house]] to meet with [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]]. [[Aolani|Ao]] and [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] remain armoured and pretend to be bodyguards for [[Brezek]], [[Tiscordin]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] who are wearing city finery. The greeter informs us that the next auction is planned for ten days time and will start at 11am, but that we're welcome to browse.

As the group start to make their way around the room they spot a number of items of incredible value. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] casts a Detect Magic and two items in particular light up. A suit of armour in brilliant gold which appears to be a +3 Mithril Armour set priced at 200k gp, and a finely crafted circle that appears to be a Circlet of Stars priced at 100k gp. We also see members of the Herquen family, who appear to all be Furbolgs. The cases all light up with a magical essence of abjuration magic. Finally, the guards scattered around and keeping watch all light up. Both their weapons and their armour glow with magical essence. Groups are posted at specific locations around the room and the only moving guard appears to be the bodyguards of the Herquen family members. It becomes obvious that stealing from under their nose comes at serious risk.

The group find [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Lady Cho]] standing in front of the Starry Night canvas studying it. She knows the thieves guild and tells the group that they have a common enemy in them. She offers to buy the painting and get it to us before the auction even begins. In exchange, she wishes for us to destroy the thieves guild. We ask if she can get us an audience with the professor at the University, which she agrees to.

The ball is also brought up in conversation, and, covertly, whether Lumen's desire to make a pass at Kai Oda would be advisable. She advises that any attempt on him would be misguided. However, she agrees to get us invited to the ball and for Borin to get an audience with [[King Caladeth Kalvenen|the King]] to plead his case for support. As Cho moves to exit, Ao notices that she's wearing a gem on the back of her hand which appears to be emanating magic essence of protection.

The group heads to [[Boldbottom's Boutique]] and buy a number of potions including Haste, Fly and others. After, we return to [[Kalvenen#Xuan's Books|Xuan's Books]] and down into the sewers. Kimvac uses a ring that he presses against the wall. The wall slides open and the group enters. Tiscordin summons ravens and starts to scout ahead.

Ahead, we find a fork with three paths. One leads to an area with dwellings, one seems to be a dead-end and the centre and last path opens out to a bigger chamber down which is shambling a four-legged fungus creature with a sharp maw. Combat ensues and the group finds the creature hardier than expected. It appears to be resistant to fire and immune to lightning, but vulnerable to Force, Necrotic and Thunder damage and have an AC of 17.
