Delving deeper into the ruins, the group starts to think that the city of [[Kalvenen]] has been built over the top of an ancient elvish city. Cavern ceilings seem to range between ten and thirty feet high as we move between chambers. The dwarves build their citadels and cities into the cavern, but this city feels more like it has collapsed and was once above ground.

The elvish city would have been known as [[Vaxalin]]. The group start to investigate the buildings and strangely start to find that, despite the lack of light, there is a soft glow being emitted by the plants. We come across a small Arc Cell that has been wrapped by plant roots, and it appears to be slowly draining the arcane energy from it. The plants are glowing with more light than the cell would provide, and we assume that it must be drawing more power from somewhere. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] remove the cell before we move on and finds it half drained.

The group returns to the central pathway and [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] starts to cast Detect Magic while Rámainen starts scouting further down the path. [[Aolani|Ao]] experiments with arcane light vs natural fire light. The plants appear to follow the arcane source but don't react at all to the natural fire light. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] finds a medium Arc Cell after his detect magic also shows the plants are glowing with a similar effect to that of the cell themselves. Continuing on we eventually find a crossroad surrounded by buildings.

Scouting with familiars reveals that the two left tunnels contain a courtyard with statues and a less linear part of the city. The right path appears to be the direction the roots are following. The group goes down the path leading to the courtyard first and notice that the ground has been disturbed as if the path is still in use. Some kind of bipedal creature tracks have been left in the dirt, dust and roots that resemble plant feet and scratches similar to the marks left by the fungus creature are prevalent and seem to freely enter and exit the path.

We eventually reach the courtyard and find it's approximately 120ft across with a mild slopping decline for about ten feet from the edge making a slight bowl. The place appears to be important as time has gone into making it a centrepiece to the area.

[[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] removes the plant life from one of the elves and reveals a plaque that says [[Adikas Bentant]]. [[Aolani|Ao]], [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] and [[Tiscordin]] move around the other statues clearing vines and find some familiar names.

[[Aolani|Ao]] reveals the name of two elves but the name that stands out is of a gnomish being. The name reads [[Duchess Joci Bellowfern#Jelin Bellowfern|Jelin Bellowfern]] and appears to be the ancestor of the current ruler of [[Bellowfern]], [[Duchess Joci Bellowfern]].

[[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] reveals two more elvish names and one of a human man, [[King Caladeth Kalvenen#Pargir Kalvenen|Pargir Kalvenen]], ancestor of [[King Caladeth Kalvenen]].

[[Tiscordin]]'s statues are all of elves and none of the names are familiar.

Of these statues, some are marked with their achievements and we come to understand that each is recognised for some level of scientific achievement. [[Adikas Bentant]] is credited for the creation of Arc Cells and [[King Caladeth Kalvenen#Pargir Kalvenen|Kalvenen]] & [[Duchess Joci Bellowfern#Jelin Bellowfern|Bellowfern]] are recognised for scientific importance in connection with life preservation. Each nameplate also has a date attached and all appear to pre-date the empire.

[[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] & [[Aolani|Ao]] go up the north path and discover a formerly fancy building with an arched sign over the entrance that reads "Science Academy of [[Vaxalin]]" while Tiscord does some basic line drawings and annotations for each of the statues and their feats. From [[Tiscordin]]'s reading on the city of [[Kalvenen]], he recalls that the founder of the city was called [[King Caladeth Kalvenen#Rakir Kalvenen|Rakir Kalvenen]] and appears to look similar to the face of the statue but predates the founding of the city by thirty to fourty years. We draw the assumption that this must be his father.

[[Tiscordin]] sends [[Tiscordin#Rámainen|Rámainen]] to scout the remaining paths and finds two directions are blocked. As [[Aolani|Ao]] and [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] are scouting the academy, [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] spots four plan creatures that attack the party. After clearing them, the group heads inside.

Heading down a staircase we discover inside, [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] forces open a door and finds a laboratory with a coffin like container on a raised platform. It's connected to a terminal, and the group bring out Elzana with hopes to understand what they've found. She attempts to break into the terminal and successfully manages to download the data from it. The coffin was previously used to preserve life for an extended period. She specifies the plans were forwarded onto another site named [[Elaran]]. [[Elaran]] is north of [[Oda]] on the sea coast and appears to be marked as Site E on the map we previously saw from [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]]. Returning back up the stairs and away from the courtyard the group find that the path appears to loop back on itself and returns to the path they initially came down to reach the area. Along the way, we find a large Arc Cell and 200gp in Elvish currency.

We head back in the direction the roots were leading and find a massive plant with a purple-ish glow underneath. We realise the plant has attached itself to an enormous Arc Cell, bigger than we could possible get out of the ruin, and the source of power lighting the roots. [[Aolani|Ao]] rolls a small Arc Cell towards the plant and a tendril slowly reaches out and pull it into a flower. [[Aolani|Ao]] and [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] slowly approach within 50ft before turning back and convening with [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] and [[Tiscordin]] who are in discussion theorising that [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Lady Cho]] is running the bookstore information network. Her knowledge of all manner of things, including the thieves guild, is suspicious. We theorise that the with the leader of the guild gone, who appears to be an underworld boss, the rest of the network may collapse and may be her motive.

We search the area and find a wealth of items including:
- 2 medium Arc Cells
- A Broach of Shielding
- A Ring of Cold Resistance
- A Drift Globe
- A Robe of Useful Items
- An Ioun Stone of Awareness

During this, [[Tiscordin]] states he doesn't wear anything that requires attunement. After prying a little, he reveals it's not that he won't be that he can't wear any more than he already is. He explains he's attuned to the Dragon Mask found in [[Rupgen]] in the cultist lair, a Periapt of Wound Closure and an item received from [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] which he keeps secret from the group.

We collect ourselves and take stock of where we are and what plans we need to achieve.
- Investigate the Blue Cloaks that have been seen near [[Bellowfern]]
- Search Site B and see if we can find anything that will help the dwarven war against the goblins
- Investigate the Starry Night painting and what it specifically depicts at the University of [[Kalvenen]]
- Crush the thieves guild in [[Nuvrin]]
- Attend the ball with the nobility of the [[Kingdom of Kalvenen]]
- Dealer collecting Arc Cells on mass near [[Vasceri]]
- Learn more about [[Aolani|Ao]]'s heritage

As we discuss, [[Aolani|Ao]] decides to test the limits of the plant that has attached itself to the Arc Cell. He approaches within 50ft and makes a slight attempt further. As he does, the plant whips out a vine. With a DC16 to escape, [[Aolani|Ao]] moves back as the plant puffs out a cloud of pollen which slowly drifts out to 60ft before slowing to a halt.

We message [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] asks whether the painting can be collected and if the introduction has been set up with the professor. She confirms the painting has been delivered to our inn and that the introduction would be made tomorrow. She providers us the name of the professor of Cosmology, [[Professor Zalkin Glowseeker]].

We return back to the surface and we head to [[Boldbottom's Boutique]] to arm ourselves appropriately for the coming escapades. During this exchange, [[Aolani|Ao]] attempts to fence some of the items removed from the Elven Ruins. Boldbottom appears keen on the exchange, but says he can only accept a small amount at a time as selling the items on takes time and comes with risk. [[Aolani|Ao]] manages to part with an elvish bow, Arc Cells and a small amount of gold intermingled with Elven coin for an Amulet of the Devout +2. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] ends up leaving with a Sentinel's Shield. After much negotiation, [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] doesn't have enough money to buy a Hat of Disguise.

Before returning to our inn, we make our way back to [[Kalvenen#Xuan's Books|Xuan's]] to ask about the defences we're likely to expect at the ball, and [[Kimvac Xuan|Xuan]] informs us an anti-magic field surrounds the ballroom, making any illusory effects disappear. [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] feels slightly better about not being able to afford his hat.
