During the two days downtime before the ball, [[Brezek]] buys a horse drawn cart to do up and attach his Mechanipig to. He spends the next couple of days making it as visually appealing as he can.

[[Tiscordin]] looks for a Tailor with little presence but enough skill and time to make a custom order for him. He finds Edna Mode, an ostentatious and severe woman with a distain for capes. While there, [[Aolani|Ao]] gets some black and gold finery made to stifle how obvious his armour is and give him some more refinement for the formal ball setting. [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]], wanting a duelists cape, is disappointed Edna won't make his request and says he'll go elsewhere. During conversation, she brings up the name of her competitor, [[Jade Wish]].

The group head to the university near the citadel in the [[Kalvenen#Upper Markets|Upper Markets]] district of [[Kalvenen]]. [[Aolani|Ao]] notices that the university has some similarities with the elven architecture we've seen in the ruins below the city, as though some aspects have been built around an existing elvish structure. The group pull up to the university on the cart, the painting, still in its crate, masked as scrap to avoid detection. We pull the crate out of the cart and head inside where we find a information desk placed centrally in the large stone entry chamber. Approaching the studious man behind the desk, we ask after [[Professor Zalkin Glowseeker]]. The man confirms he is the professor of Astronomy and gives us the name of the building, "Monarch Building", to find his offices within on the second floor. He tells us to look for an observatory, that's hard to miss, and his study can be found within.

Walking through the corridors, we pick out a plaque that lists names of professors. One is [[Professor Zalkin Glowseeker]], but the group also notice the names of several members of [[The Arcandor Academy]]. This puts the group on edge a bit, but quickly scanning areas around as we walk we see no additional guard force or other presence that worries us. [[The Arcandor Academy]] has a bad reputation among poorer or smaller villages, as they are often seen as stealing people for the academies. More problematic in smaller villages where hands are lost to work fields and families are torn apart, their reputation over the years has eroded to one of disdain. In complete contrast, however, in high societies it is often seen as a status symbol for one of a family to be enlisted into the rank of mages that study within their ranks. They guard their secrets very carefully, and are rumoured to have libraries full of knowledge and spells not revealed to any outside their rank.

We make our way in the direction we have been pointed in, and along the way find statues of old deans of the university. Students are out in deep conversation on all sorts of topics, and we are generally left to our own devices and not paid much attention. As we arrive and knock on the professor's door, we enter to find a halfling man in his later years who looks a little ragged and unkempt for his station within a prestigious university, but he appears to pay it no mind. His office is full to the brim of books and star maps, and all the furniture is scaled appropriately for his size. A few human size chairs dot the room for guests, but his desk and equipment is appropriate for him.

We mention the name of [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Duchess Cho]] to him and he recognises us as the group he was told would be attending him. He welcomes us neutrally and the group get swiftly to the matter of the Starry Night painting. We place it on his desk and he quickly becomes enamoured with it, pulling books from his shelves and staring intently into the scene almost forgetting we're in the room. Some time passes and, eventually, he snaps back to his senses. He tells us that it's an impressive representation of actual constellations and star formations. The alignment has not been seen for 1500 years, but, coincidentally, is likely to reoccur in the next two months. He believes it shows a sky scape that would be seen slightly north facing in the [[Fractured Mountains]].

He doesn't understand if it has any Elvish significance. [[Aolani|Ao]] considers to himself that [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] may be able to give us some indication whether an event or other such reason would exist for an artist to depict this sky. Several bright spots can be seen, and [[Professor Zalkin Glowseeker|Professor Glowseeker]] informs us these are actually planets. Whatever the event was, it is likely to have been considered a powerful celestial event. He muses that the artist must have been a skilled Astronomer to have depicted this scene so precisely. [[Professor Zalkin Glowseeker|Zalkin]] doesn't believe in power coming from celestial events, saying he would leave such things to those who believe mysticism over science. He mentions that there is a druidic circle along the river somewhere and that, should we believe in such things, they may be able to help.

The majority of the group go to find more information about the artist, seeing if there's any significance or known connection between [[Eshin Himed]] and any organisations. [[Aolani|Ao]] stays with [[Professor Zalkin Glowseeker|Zalkin]] while he spends a few hours studying it further to get some more precise information for the group. The rest of the group goes and finds a Professor Wildbranch, a grey furred Tabaxi whose patterning implies that once they may have been black. They claim that [[Eshin Himed]] was once a promising young artist that really became famous for the Starry Night painting. It came out of the blue and, though he had painted landscapes before, it was the first and only nightscape created by the artist. Sadly, it would be his last painting as the artist died young and in a mysterious way, turning up dead and alone in his house. [[Windfall]] was his home city, and rumours there suggested that he fell in with the wrong crowd and that this may have been the cause of his death. He died a couple of hundred years ago. Nothing was ever written about him being an astronomer though, so the professor can't speak to its accuracy.

Eventually, [[Professor Zalkin Glowseeker|Professor Glowseeker]] finishes his studies. He proudly proclaims that it's actually quite near [[Windfall]] and that the scene should be visible from within the city but is probably closer to the foothills of the mountain. There are exactly 39 days until the even. Looking at the maps of the professor, [[Aolani|Ao]] estimates that it will take 14 days to travel to [[Windfall]] by foot.

Regrouping, we head to [[Kalvenen#Xuan's Books|Xuan's Books]] and ask after the Druid Grove. [[Kimvac Xuan|Kimvac]] informs us that the grove is north of the city following the river. [[Dubas Nicade]], political advisor to [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]], meets us at the bookstore and gives us some information on the dukes [[Duke Castac Cindervale|Cindervale]], [[Duke Udavon Windfall|Windfall]], [[Duke Lakeo Visceri|Visceri]] and [[Duke Kai Oda|Oda]]. All of the nobility have standing military assets, but theoretically they all belong to the [[King Caladeth Kalvenen|King]]. Any personal guard then is self funded and acts as a protection force. [[Dubas Nicade|Dubas]] also informs us that the nobility will enter and exit the ball from a different entry than the commoners.

[[Aolani|Ao]] decides to pop the canvas from its frame, gently cutting the tape that holds it in place. He finds an annotation that says "Mossbreak - [[Windfall]]" on the back. [[Brezek]] uses mending and returns the frame to its previous state, canvas intact. [[Brezek]] is concerned that he may become violent with the nobility if they don't appreciate the plight of the Dwarves

We arrive at the ball and notice a large contingent of guards, all looking almost identical. Some have ribbons or crests that denote their rank. [[Brezek]] elects to stay outside with the cart while the rest of the group go up the three tiers of stairs to the entry. Wood and gold filigree ornate the decorations with portraits of former kings lining the walls. Chandeliers ornament the ceilings and guards mike it obvious where patrons should go. Finely dressed people queue to get in with a checkpoint setup to search people before they enter. As guests enter, an announcer greets them and asks if they wish to be introduced, and most provide an introduction to be called as they enter the great hall.

The edges of the rooms and corners are much darker than the centre. A 12-man band plays in the centre of the room, allowing a dance floor to be used while not smothering conversation. Massive windows line either side of the hall with massive velvet curtains on either side. Guards are positioned around the edges at regular intervals and food is set up on a banquet table at one end of the hall with a champaign fountain serenely trickling in the background. People in finery walk the area with intention, and [[Aolani|Ao]] intuits that these are likely mages blending with the crowd.

As [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] attempts to enter he is stopped by the guards who tell him he needs to relinquish his weapons. He refuses, claiming that, as a dwarf, it goes against his religion to force him to relinquish his hammers and drops [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]]'s name as being the one to invite the group. A manager is called and [[Tiscordin]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] enter ahead of the others. A guard of high rank appears and tells [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] that he can keep his hammer, but he will be given a guard at all times who will follow him where he goes as a precaution. In a huff, he enters and informs announcer he wishes to be introduced as "[[Borin Ironfist]] and entourage". [[Aolani|Ao]], somewhat embarrassed about the scene being made, hangs back as [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] enters leaving just himself and his guard to enter awkwardly with the announcement. As [[Tiscordin]] enters, the disguise he has cast on himself dissipates and reveals an ostentatious outfit of bright yellow sequins glinting in the light. As [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] enters, he feels something draw the life from him and his face droops slightly before snapping back.

[[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]] is already at the ball & several groups with entourages congregate around the room. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] notice a woman they recognise from a previous encounter called [[Anika]]. Around the room we also see a large man who we assume to be [[Duke Udavon Windfall|Duke Windfall]] and as we mill around, [[Duke Castac Cindervale|Duke Cindervale]] is announced, then [[Duchess Dalaia Kosrias|Duchess Kosrias]] and [[Duke Kai Oda|Duke Oda]]. We understand that, in order of entry, the nobility have arrived in the following order:
- [[Duchess Joci Bellowfern|Duchess Bellowfern]]
- [[Duchess Isveeh Nostar|Duchess Nostar]]
- [[Duke Lakeo Visceri|Duke Visceri]]
- [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Duchess Nuvrin]]
- [[Duke Udavon Windfall|Duke Windfall]]
- [[Duke Castac Cindervale|Duke Cindervale]]
- [[Duchess Dalaia Kosrias|Duchess Kosrias]]
- [[Duke Kai Oda|Duke Oda]]

[[Dubas Nicade|Dubas]] had mentioned the nobility would most likely attempt to enter as close to the king as possible, one of the political games of the court with each member attempting to use their entry as a status symbol. The closer to the king, the more they believe their importance in the court.

[[Tiscordin]] is approached by a Tabaxi asking where he got his outfit, a garish sequinned affair
