[[Aolani|Ao]] walks the cavernous room & finds little of note. It's a flat room with signage pointing to chests of spare parts and to a terminal in the room. Elzana informs the group that thirty people would have had access to the R&D building, and that fifteen to twenty may have been involved in construction of the mechanical construct in front of us.

The group positions TBD back in the central cavern to inform us if anyone moves through it, then [[Aolani|Ao]], [[Tiscordin]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] leave [[Brezek]] to study the construct and head towards the temple cavern. We descend a spiral staircase to a more luxurious living space with a lake and lavish homes. In the centre of the lake is a building that looks like a temple with a dead-straight walkway leading to the entrance. It seems to be a naturally occurring lake and the temple is of modest size for the area.

[[Aolani|Ao]] casts light on a rock and throws it into the lake. After 50ft, the light disappears from sight and we can only assume it's dropped from sight. It's a large lake, and we estimate it's about a mile wide. [[Tiscordin]] explains that he and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] are looking for a component to a device they found in [[Milanalin]]. They think it'll allow them to translate Elvish freely.

In conversation, [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] says that the people of [[Oda]] reveer wood. The people are merchants for the most part and ship their goods down the river Hoard, which he claims gets its name from the amount of gold that comes back from their trade.

The buildings are definitely houses for those of significant wealth. [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] & [[Aolani|Ao]] start to cross the bridge while [[Tiscordin]] waits on the other side. Unknown to [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] & [[Aolani|Ao]], [[Tiscordin]] flies off in Raven form to explore the houses. The pair see something in the water as they start to cross and decide to dash across to the other side. Six creatures leap from the water and emerge onto the bridge. Two have weapons and four seem to be unarmed other than their natural claws and teeth. [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] and [[Aolani|Ao]] manage to dispatch them without much problem and continue across the bridge.

At the other side, the stone door has a symbol which [[Aolani|Ao]] recognises as the symbol of a black lotus shedding its petals as that of [[Erador]], the god of endings, war and loss. Confused as to why the symbology taught by [[The Great Coucil]] would be on an Elvish temple, the two enter. Inside there is more iconography of [[Erador]]; it's different from modern depictions but not to the extent that is entirely alien. Within a stone desk, [[Aolani|Ao]] finds a secret compartment holding a tablet similar to the technology of the terminals. The walls hold depictions of [[Erador]] leading groups of Elves ready for war.

While [[Aolani|Ao]] & [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] are in the temple, [[Tiscordin]] goes to search the estate and finds the High Marshall's property where be believes he may find the component missing from the translator. He enters the estate using Misty Step & searches for the office. Under the desk, he finds a hidden compartment within which is a complete version of the broken device & a necklace which was similar to that of the one found in [[Milanalin]]. The device, when activated with the necklace, shines a light that displays a translation key.

[[Tiscordin]] holds a journal written in a secret elven cypher. It is this which can be translated with the translation key. It's a item known to most of the party. [[Tiscordin]] speculates that the elves may have been the initial draconic cultists and lead a coup against their people with the dragons.

[[Tiscordin]], [[Aolani|Ao]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] come back together and start to discuss asking questions of the cultist they'd killed in the central cavern:
- Does the dragon cult have any influence in [[Oda]]?
- How many cultists are in the ruins, less those that had been killed?
- What is the position & name of the one who leads you?
- Do the group have influence in any of the dukedoms?
- What were you searching for?
- What were you going to do if you found it?
- Did you find it?

The cultist tells us that they are lead by [[Gemmen Zrayax]], and that they were searching for the Sahaugin. He refers to them as "Those that live below", and explains they were here to get them to join the cause of the cult.

Returning back to the central cavern, the three check in with TBD who has not seen cultists emerge from the tunnel they ran down. [[Tiscordin]] summons ravens and scouts down the path, finding tracks that lead to a central square and into one of the buildings. The group creep down, and once [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] is spotted, [[Aolani|Ao]] and [[Tiscordin]] use fear effects to terrify the cultists. [[Aolani|Ao]] intimidates the cultists, and gets them to tell us where [[Gemmen Zrayax]] can be found. They tell us we can find him in the Snoring Drum in the Salt Stair district of [[Nuvrin]]. He's a bald man with a tattooed face in a strange script.

During the fight, [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] lifts his mask and reveals his face to one of the cultists. While the cultists are intimidated, [[Tiscordin]] asks what [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]]'s face looks like. After a contested roll of intimidation, the cultist reveals that [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] has a bloody skull with eye lids for a face. After getting everything they need, the three take no prisoners and kill the remaining men. Searching their bodies, we find:
- 80gp
- A necklace with a cult symbol (home made)
- A sealed tube likely containing parchment.

Next, the group turns their attention to the dwellings around them. After a brief search, the group find three small Arc Cells as well as three shrines to [[Erador]] showing different depictions of other gods of the Elvish race as well. [[Aolani|Ao]] collects these to take back to [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] for identification.

Returning back to the central chamber, the group decide to briefly search the forest area. They find it's more of a park than a forest. A river flows further underground and on its surface appear to be boats for gentle travel.

Finally, the group returns back to meet up with [[Brezek]] and get ready to rest. [[Aolani|Ao]] brings out the tablet which Elzana translates. It's a religious text that will require 5-6 hours of reading to fully digest.

After reading, [[Aolani|Ao]] finds that it contains teachings of [[Erador]] which correspond with the rhetoric preached by [[The Great Coucil]]. It appears the council has kept of of the teachings the same, but expunged any content about the elves, censoring the information that would link the teachings to them.
