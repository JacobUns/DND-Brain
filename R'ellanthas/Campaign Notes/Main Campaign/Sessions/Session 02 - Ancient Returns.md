More description is provided of the shady figure mentioned in the [[Rupgen#Jolly Clam Inn|Jolly Clam Inn]]. He is a human with dark hair and a posh accent. No one seems to know his name, but his house is always closed up with shutters.

The group approach the house, on the lookout for any suspicious individuals as we leave [[Rupgen#Jolly Clam Inn|Jolly Clam Inn]]. From a distance, [[Aolani|Ao]] manages to pick out the house that's closed up (**Perception** roll of **24**). [[Tiscordin]] summons 3 ravens to surcle the strange house and scout the general area while [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] approaches the door and knocks. There is no answer, so [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] sneaks around to the back door & attempts to pick the lock. He fails (**Thieves Tools Check** of **14**), and so he pulls out a bottle with a label reading "Lock-be-gone" and pours some of the contents on the lock. About half the contents remains, but the lock itself completely disappears.

The group attempt to stealth into the house, but [[Brezek]] and [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] make a signficant amount of noise (**Stealth** of **7** and **1** respectively). All the same, no noise greets the group as they enter the building. [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] uses Detect Magic and identifies a hatch in the floor which is glowing. It appears to be emanating protective magic similar to a ward or alarm. Other than the hatch, the house looks as though it is not being used as living quarters and the group assume it is acting as a front.

[[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] slips Greta, his great warhammer, off his back and goes to smash the floor. [[Brezek]], cautious of the noise about to be made, stops him and uses a crowbar to lift a floorboard around the edge of the hatch. Not having much success, the group decides to retreat until they have had a chance to prepare themselves to remove the enchantment. The group close up the hatch again after investigating the area and [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] alarms the trapdoor again as the group put the house back as it was intending to leave and return the next day.

We make our way to meet [[Professor Sikud]] at his lecture hall and he leads us to his office. He leads us to a wall and, surprisingly, he starts dancing more gracefully than his age would imply he would be capable. Suddenly, the wall slides open and [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] leads us down to a room filled to the brim with Elven items and displays. [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] trusts [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Duchess Cho]] greatly, and claims they spent much time discussing many things but that now [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Cho]] mostly asks questions of him.

The group starts to ask questions of [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] on some of the items found it previous ruins. He explains that Arc Cells can be used to focus magic & greatly increase the potency of it. He also unfurls a map with marked locations which read sites A to E and Vaxalim. He explains that he has only been to the site under [[Kalvenen]], but that he knows of other sites by name. Site C he calls Mirakian and Site D Leoquen. He doesn't know what sites B and E were called in the elvish language.

He explains that the site under [[Kalvenen]] can only be accessed via a bookstore and that, as far as he is aware, there is a terminal to charge cells in Site D. As the group walks the halls, they find a strange little construct, larger than Elzana. Tapestries and paintings adorn the walls depicting groups of elves stood above a sea of eyes, each pair belonging to a variety of races that the elves ruled over. Where the history of [[The Great Coucil]] implies the Elves were tyrannical, the depictions he's found and histories he has studied make [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] believe that people looked up to the Elves. Within the painting, we notice some lizard-like people we don't recognise the races of.

The group discuss and believe that Site B may be a location where [[Borin Ironfist|Borin]] could find weaponry to aid in the Dwarven war against the Goblins. Believing we have as much information as we're likely to get, we ask [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] if he has anything that might be of aid to us in further investigating the ruins. Each member ends up with an item or two of elvish nature.

As [[Aolani|Ao]] browses, he notes a statue of an Elven deity. An expert on the pantheon as taught by [[The Great Coucil]], [[Aolani|Ao]] doesn't recognise this being, but [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] explains that it is an Elven representation of their god of War and Nature.

We get into further conversation with [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] about how he got into the study of Elven artefacts. He explains that he started with a group looking to make money, but as time went on they were slowly picked off one by one by the [[Guardians of Il'Mondum]]. He decided it would be a better path, and less likely to end up with losing his life, to study the artefacts rather than sell them. He specifically focused on investigations into whether the Elves were misrepresented by history. The elves seemed to be far more advanced than the current level of civilisation, and whether actually the quality of life was better for all when the elves existed.

We ask whether [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] has heard of the name [[Ral Moonshine]]. It's a name he knows in the underground of smuggling artefacts, but doesn't know personally. He's an unsavory character, one who extorts others to get rich without heed for the consequences to them. [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] is concerned by the use of Arc Cells by Ral. [[Brezek]] discusses with [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]] his investigation into Arc Cells, and he lends us a Huge Arc Cell. In return, [[Tiscordin]] reveals the existence of Elzana to him, and lends him the construct while we move on to our current target.

The group rests for the night and, in the morning, make their way back to the front-house. [[Aolani|Ao]] dispells the trapdoor and the group travel down the hole. We reach a room with obsidian walls that [[Tiscordin]] and [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] recognise. They explain that near Buckrow they had found a similar chamber and had ultimately found it was connected to Dragons. The room is unlike anything the rest of us have seen before and could only be made by the artistry of dragons or elves, and this appears to be the former.

![[Dragon Room - Rupgen.png]]At the end of a corridor is a circular room. There are slits in the floor at compass points and four pipes that almost reach the floor hang down the walls. Swinging blades start to emerge from the walls, running through the slits, as water starts to pour out of the pipes, flooding the room. With effort, the party manage to break down the door and turn off the traps before continuing. Through the panic, [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] has sat himself down at the entry and gone into a meditation. [[Aolani|Ao]], frustrated at the lack of assistance from the man, raises his bladed mace towards [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] threateningly. He demands an explanation, as he believes secrets are being kept too closely that risk the rest of their lives. Finally, [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] explains.

He was communicating with the Will of a Black Dragon who calls itself [[Gerunuth, the Death Lord|Gerunuth]], the Death Lord. The obsidian area is the former lair of the dragon & that there is some kind of item there that [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] is looking for, which would be beneficial to both us and the dragon. He also mentions stones that have been found previously by the party.

While the party talks, [[Brezek]] continues down the corridor out and finds a room full of armed creatures. Acting quickly, he fires an object into the crowd that starts screaming & intimidates the beings. There stands a wizard with a glossy mask and around him swarm a horde of Kobolds. The Kobolds are blue, their scales glossy and a ridged horn protruding from the centre of their snouts. They attack the party, and during the skirmish [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] is knocked down. After the wizard is felled and the Kobolds dispatched, [[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] is brought to and approaches the wizard reaching down to take a mask from him.

[[Lumen Keijo|Lumen]] explains that he wants the mask to help him in his plans to kill [[Duke Kai Oda|Duke Oda]]. The two spend some time explaining some of what they know of the dragons. They reveal knowledge of six dragons.
- Blue Dragon - [[San Delanthluth, the Victorious]]
- Green Dragon - [[Ezzanreth, the Powerful]]
- White Dragon - [[Iqanihiro, Bringer of Death]]
- Red Dragon - [[Creoisaloth, Lady of Red]]
- Red Dragon - [[Qyuilotho, Champion of the Red]]
- Black Dragon - [[Gerunuth, the Death Lord]]

The group take a minute to collect themselves. Kobolds have not been seen since [[the Ending War]], and their existence, and the revelations of [[Professor Sikud|Sikud]], have the party slightly shaken. They return to the surface and their rooms in the [[Rupgen#Jolly Clam Inn|Jolly Clam Inn]], and make a plan to go to [[Nuvrin]] and report to [[Duchess Cho Nuvrin|Duchess Cho]]. We report that the spies we have been investigating appear to be connected to dragons, and she asks us to investigate further and report back.
