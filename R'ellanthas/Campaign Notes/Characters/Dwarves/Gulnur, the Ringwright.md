# About
[[Gulnur, the Ringwright]] was one of the foremost artificers of the dwarves in his life. A devout follower of [[Pantheon of R'Ellanthas#Orag, the Hammer|Orag, the Hammer]], he became so prolific and had such a mastery of the arcane in conjunction with his craft, that he ascended death by binding his soul to the forge he worked within. Towards the end of his life he would become known as the Ringwright, the first of the [[Dwarven Ringsmiths|Ringsmiths]], and, in his ethereal state, would bestowed his knowledge of smithing to each [[Dwarven Ringsmiths|Ringsmith]] to train at the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|Citadel]]. 

He claims to have been alive before the start of the goblin war, more than ~1000+ year ago, but he does not know why the war started. 200 years before the ending war started, the goblins were made by the elves and were sent to attack the dwarves, but this was as much as he knows on the subject.
