Western Gate - Not been opened in years
Eastern Gate
Warzone - Goblin and Dwarven war rages on in the city

- Staircase that led from high in the mountain down inside. Likely very tricky to find.
- Other lesser known entranceways that may be more rumour than anything
- Ventilation shafts on the side of the mountain. Difficult to access and navigate
- Massive complex that runs 40 miles through the mountain
- Deeps of the mines as well as the main bulk of the city. Multi-levelled city structure
- Gates east and west were level zero, every level above was a level up, and every level below was a deep.
