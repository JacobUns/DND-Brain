# About
The Citadel of the [[Dwarven Ringsmiths|Ringsmiths]] would be built in honour of [[Gulnur, the Ringwright]]. Its awe-inspiring halls would be carved into the mountain and city of [[Bal Toruhm]] to commemorate and house the soul of [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]]. As [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|The Rightwright]]'s soul was bound to his forge before the death of the master craftsman, the citadel would be built around the famous workshop.
